<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 2</p>
<p>The final decision depended on him .  He fidgeted again with the E-Rank magic core in his hands, then looked to his side .  Juhee shook her head at his eyes . She had a bad feeling about this . Well, even Jinwoo felt the same way .  Under any other circumstance, he would not have dared to jump into danger . After all, he lacked the skills and courage to do so .  But Jinwoo had a little sister, who was preparing for college . </p>
<p>‘I don’t have anything saved up for that…’</p>
<p>He was 24 years old, but he had to give up on college due to their poverty .  He didn’t want that poverty to hinder his sister’s life as well . </p>
<p>Their lives were counting on every penny that came and went .  Mr . Park wasn’t the only one who needed money . </p>
<p>Jinwoo raised his hand . </p>
<p>“I’ll also go . ”</p>
<p>At his side, Juhee let out a small sigh disappointedly . </p>
<p>-2 . Double Dungeon-</p>
<p>The tunnel went on and on and on .  At the vanguard stood Mr . Song and other veteran Hunters .  Led by the light from the fireball in Mr . Song’s hand, the party walked through the dimly lit tunnel . </p>
<p>Mr . Kim spoke up from the party, “Isn’t this going in a little too deep? Maybe we should think about turning back . ”</p>
<p>“How long have we been walking?”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim checked his watch, “About… 40 minutes . ”</p>
<p>“When we take down the boss, we’ll have 1 hour before the Gate closes .  Taking into account the time for the return trip, we still have a breathing room of 20 minutes, right?”</p>
<p>“Then if we don’t come across the boss after 20 more minutes of walking, we should leave, right?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so . ”</p>
<p>Nodding, Mr . Song pointed towards his back with his thumb . </p>
<p>“Hey Mr . Kim, it’s dark ahead of me, so fall back a little bit . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim looked at Mr . Song’s fireball, then took out his cellphone and turned on its flashlight function .  The light from the phone brightly illuminated their path . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Looking back and forth between his fireball and the phone’s light, Mr . Song quietly searched pockets for his phone . </p>
<p>At the rear of the party walked Jinwoo, who was injured, and Juhee, who had no fighting skills .  Jinwoo scratched his head . </p>
<p>“I’m… sorry . ”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“Dragging you along like this . ”</p>
<p>“I’m fine .  You don’t have to worry about me . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo discretely read her expression .  It was not a face without worry . Tilting his head, Jinwoo carefully asked,</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Juhee abruptly turned to face him,</p>
<p>“Of course I’m not okay! Are you in your right mind?! Earlier, if the place you were stabbed in was just a bit higher, it would’ve pierced your heart! And what about the injuries on your wrist and thigh?! I barely healed all those, and you’re already jumping into another Dungeon? Especially when you don’t know anything about it?”</p>
<p>At her rant, Jinwoo felt himself becoming light-headed .  But she was not wrong . Juhee was a Healer-class Hunter, and more than that, a B-Rank Hunter .  A rare sight in the Association . If it was not for her healing, Jinwoo would’ve probably succumbed to injuries that would’ve put his normal life out of commission, much less being a Hunter . </p>
<p>‘I really owe her a lot…’</p>
<p>A Healer-class Hunter . </p>
<p>Not only that, a B-Rank Healer-class Hunter . </p>
<p>Whenever a Gate appeared, the Association would request her as a healer, and of course, Jinwoo would always find himself sitting or lying down next to her in treatment in their Raids . </p>
<p>“You’re hurting, right? Please hang in there . ”</p>
<p>“You look familiar… are you from that time…?”</p>
<p>“You got hurt again?”</p>
<p>“Seems like I see you again and again . ”</p>
<p>“You said your name was Jinwoo? Are you… alright?”</p>
<p>“Do you ever think maybe the Hunter-life isn’t for you…?”</p>
<p>“ . You’re here again . ”</p>
<p>“Hold out your arm .  No, not there, you can mend that with just bandages, the other arm . ”</p>
<p>Surpassing his gratitude, he now felt apologetic to her . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Seeing his silent face, Juhee felt bad about her rant and calmed down . </p>
<p>“Are you really sorry?”</p>
<p>“Of course . ”</p>
<p>After some thought, Juhee looked at Jinwoo at her side, with corners of her mouth rising ever so slightly,</p>
<p>“Well… maybe you could treat me to a meal sometime . ”</p>
<p>It was not a response he expected .  Shocked, Jinwoo looked at Juhee’s face, now showing a mischievous smile .  ‘A girl…’  He remembered Juhee was 20 going on 21 .  If she had cut her long hair into a proper length and put on a school uniform, she’d be a fitting image of a student . Imagining her in a uniform, his face blushed . </p>
<p>Seeing his delayed response, Juhee blew air into her cheeks and pouted . </p>
<p>“Do you… not want to eat with me?”</p>
<p>It was then . </p>
<p>Suddenly, a commotion rose from the vanguard of the party . </p>
<p>“This is it!”</p>
<p>“The boss room!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo and Juhee turned their gazes forward . </p>
<p>There stood a giant door signaling the end of the tunnel .  The Hunters gathered before the door . </p>
<p>“To think there was a door at the end of the tunnel . ”</p>
<p>“Do you think this was always here?”</p>
<p>“First time I’m seeing something like this… . ”</p>
<p>“Do . do you think it’s dangerous?”</p>
<p>As they quietly whispered back and forth, the Hunters became uneasy .  After all, their lives were on the line; they had to be careful . But too much care may impede progress, Mr . Song thought . </p>
<p>“So you guys want to turn back after all that? To go back empty handed?”</p>
<p>He placed his hand on the door . </p>
<p>“You’re free to go back .  I’ll go alone . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Song was a C-Rank Hunter with 10 years of experience .  If it wasn’t for the fact that he was past 60 years old, he could’ve probably raided under a large Guild . </p>
<p>So when such a veteran Hunter spoke with confidence, the uneasiness of the other Hunters slowly disappeared . </p>
<p>“Now that I think about it,” One of the Hunters spoke of a rumor regarding Double Dungeons, “I heard that Double Dungeons have some crazy treasures . ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I heard some mid-level Guild once found a Double Dungeon and shot straight to a large Guild status!”</p>
<p>“And wherever magic beasts may appears in a Dungeon, they should all be the same level generally…”</p>
<p>And so the Hunters thought, what if this Double Dungeon contained a phenomenal treasure? And what if the magic beasts beyond this door were the same level as before?</p>
<p>‘Can’t let that old man take all the treasures by himself . ’</p>
<p>‘Mm, of course . ’</p>
<p>‘Forget just postnatal, I could probably pay for a big private school, pay for the mortgage…’</p>
<p>And just like that, the Hunters’ understandings became one .  Even Jinwoo renewed his determination . </p>
<p>‘I can’t just return with a E-Rank magic core .  At the very least, a D-Rank, no, just even one more E-Rank is good enough . ’</p>
<p>It didn’t have to be a magic beast either . </p>
<p>‘If we find treasure beyond that door…’</p>
<p>It was a standard agreement that any treasures or artifacts found in a Dungeon would be divided evenly amongst party members .  This was different than the case where magic core from magic beasts would only go to the members who helped take a target down . </p>
<p>‘If I can score big right here, I can rest easy for a bit…’</p>
<p>Seeing his determined face, Juhee asked from his side,</p>
<p>“Is that really the face of someone who Hunts as a ‘hobby’?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo shrugged,</p>
<p>“Who would risk their lives for work these days? But for a hobby, that’s another story . ”</p>
<p>“ . What?”</p>
<p>As Juhee put on an incredulous expression on her face, Mr . Song started pushing the door open . </p>
<p>creak~</p>
<p>Through some unknown mechanism, the giant door opened easily as the 60-year old man pushed . </p>
<p>Bang</p>
<p>The wide open door revealed a large interior, and the Hunters entered pushing past each other . </p>
<p>“We should go too . ”</p>
<p>Not wanting to fall behind, Jinwoo took Juhee’s wrist and went forward . </p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>With redness creeping onto her face, Juhee followed him . </p>
<p>As the Hunters’ first steps fell onto the ground, the numerous torches that filled the walls of the area lit up, brightly illuminating the interior . </p>
<p>“Hmm? The light went on?”</p>
<p>“First time I’m seeing that . ”</p>
<p>“Something’s… different . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters surveilled their surroundings .  It felt like the interior of a large temple .  Like an ominous temple that would be hidden away deep underground, the floors, the walls and even the ceiling was covered in moss .  Some Hunters shuddered and noted,</p>
<p>“Something feels wrong . ”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it feel like we’re being watched?”</p>
<p>The more fearful Hunters fell to the rear, while the stronger Hunters headed deeper into the room . </p>
<p>“Tsk .  Don’t say such things . ”</p>
<p>“Let’s just finish up here and go back . ”</p>
<p>The interior was incredibly large .  A wide area in a dome shape . It was comparable to multiple olympic fields being put together .  No, perhaps bigger . At the same time, it paradoxically felt cramped . The reason was simple . </p>
<p>“That that thing…”</p>
<p>“That’s not the boss, is it?”</p>
<p>At the end of the room, something whose size surpassed reason and logic sat upon a grand and enormous seat .  It could only described as a massive Statue of God[1] .  </p>
<p>“My god[2] . ”</p>
<p>“Whoa…”</p>
<p>They could not help but be amazed . </p>
<p>Jinwoo himself compared the statue’s size to America’s Statue of Liberty[3] .  ‘If the Statue of Liberty sat down, it would probably look like that . ’  Although the Statue of Liberty is female, and this one was clearly male .  ‘No… This thing’s bigger…’</p>
<p>The Hunters gathered before the statue could not help but gulp repeatedly .  They stood in fear, wondering if the Statue of God was the boss of this Dungeon . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>But the Statue did not move . </p>
<p>“Phew~”</p>
<p>Mr . Song also sighed in relief . </p>
<p>“Alright, let’s spread out . ”</p>
<p>With renewed confidence, the Hunters spread out, investigating the giant room . </p>
<p>“I don’t see any magic beasts . ”</p>
<p>“Right?”</p>
<p>“Forget magic beasts, I don’t even see a single bug . ”</p>
<p>Compared to its well-lit interiors and enormous size, the room of the Statue of God was rather plain .  Adorning its walls were countless torches, illuminating the room . In front of the torches stood statues slightly larger than the average man, forming equidistant points of a circle . </p>
<p>“Beautiful . ”</p>
<p>“It’s like a work of art . ”</p>
<p>Each statue held something different in its hands .  Some held weapons, some books, others held instruments or torches . </p>
<p>“It’s like…” Mr . Kim started describing,</p>
<p>“Decorations in a temple . ” Mr . Song finished his sentence . </p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Mr . Song found something at his feet . </p>
<p>“This is… a magic circle[4]?”</p>
<p>At the center of the temple room, there was a magic circle that he had never seen before in his life . </p>
<p>“Mr . Song, there’s something written here .  Can you come take a look at this?”</p>
<p>A Hunter called out to the Raid’s leader, finding a statue that stood out from the rest .  Leaving his observation of the magic circle, Mr . Song headed towards the Hunter . One by one, all the Hunters in the room gathered before the strange statue as well . </p>
<p>Of all the statues in the room, this one was the only one with wings .  It was holding a stone tablet . What caught the Hunters’ eyes were the words written on the stone tablet . </p>
<p>“It’s Runic[5] . ” Mr . Song spoke after analyzing the tablet . </p>
<p>Runes .  A form of text that could be found in Dungeons, it was something that could not be found elsewhere on Earth .  Only the Hunters who Awakened[6] as Mage-class could interpret them . </p>
<p>Mr . Song read the first line of the tablet:</p>
<p>“ ‘Commandments of the Cartenon Temple’[7] ” </p>
<p>Jinwoo listened to Mr . Song’s reading of the tablet with a serious expression .  But then suddenly, someone grabbed his arm . </p>
<p>Turning around, he saw Juhee looking at him with a pale, fear-stricken face . </p>

<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Statue of God” (신상 [神像]; Shin-Sang): “God” Shin + “Statue” Sang</p>
<p>[2]: “my god…”: Just an “omg”, not specifically saying that the statue was his god . </p>
<p>[3]: “Statue of Liberty”: Heel-to-Head Height: ~111 feet . </p>
<p>[4]: “Magic Circle” (마법진; Ma-Beop-Jin): “Magic” Ma-Beop + “Circle” Jin</p>
<p>[5]: “Runic” (룬 문자; Rune Mun-Ja): Rune (in English) + “Text” Mun-Ja</p>
<p>[6]: “Awakened” (각성; Gak-Sung): Terminology used to describe the phenomenon where humans awaken special powers .  Those that awaken obtain specific repertoire of abilities and skills fitting to a certain class (Fighter, Mage, Healer, etc…)</p>
<p>[7]: “Commandments of the Cartenon Temple” (카르테논 신전의 규율): The korean word for “commandments” actually is closer to an uncommon way of saying “rule”, but I’ve translated as “commandment” for a minor story purpose later on .  I couldn’t find a direct translation for “Cartenon”, so this is just a pronunciation choice . </p>
