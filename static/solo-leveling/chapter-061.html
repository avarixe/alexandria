<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 61</p>
<p>There was one more reason Jinwoo had chosen the forest . </p>
<p>‘Status screen . ’</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Without letting the others know what was happening, Jinwoo quietly changed his title from ‘One Who Has Triumphed Over Adversity’ to ‘Wolf Slayer’ . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Wolf Slayer ( . 1 more)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>All stats increased by 40% against beast type monsters . </strong>.   </p>
<p>A title given to a hunter experienced in slaying wolves . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>It was time to show off this cheat-like buff . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>A beast type monster has appeared . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The effect of the title, ‘Wolf Slayer’, has been activated . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Confirming his increased attributes, Jinwoo smiled . </p>
<p>‘Good . ’</p>
<p>It was in that moment, the other Hunters screamed,</p>
<p>“I-it’s a bear!”</p>
<p>“Ice bear!”</p>
<p>Having smelled humans, an ice bear was slowly walking towards them .  To the beast, they were enemies who had intruded on its territory . The ice bear was not looking at them nicely . </p>
<p>grrrrrl-</p>
<p>The ice bear bared its teeth and growled; its fangs were as clear as ice .  The beast stood up, towering over the Hunters . It almost covered their entire vision . </p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Although it looked like a polar bear, the beast was twice as big, and adorning its chest was the signature magic core of magic beasts . </p>
<p>Roooaaar!</p>
<p>A powerful roar that echoed in the area! Hearing its roar, all the Hunters, save for Jinwoo, froze up .  Park Heejin frowned, </p>
<p>‘What do you mean all we have to worry about are ice bears!’</p>
<p>Was that something that could be said while looking at the beast before them?! She had fallen for Sung Jinwoo’s so-called logic .  Looking at the ice bear in person, she was now sure,</p>
<p>‘We shouldn’t have entered this forest!’</p>
<p>Sensing danger, Park Heejin stepped in front of the party and shouted,</p>
<p>“I’ll grab its attention, everyone else-ahh!”</p>
<p>A powerful force grabbed the hood of her coat and pulled her back .  It was all she could to maintain her balance while being dragged backwards .  After collecting herself, she looked up and saw Jinwoo in front of her . </p>
<p>“What the hell!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo pointed a finger at her,</p>
<p>“I’m going to say this once . All the magic beasts going forward are mine . ”</p>
<p>He could not share valuable experience points after all .  To Jinwoo, these cute little bears were just the appetizer before the main course of White Walkers . </p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Park Heejin could not hide her confusion . </p>
<p>‘Did he seriously just pull me back to face the thing alone?’</p>
<p>The two C-rank Mage-class Hunters also stopped their casting and stared with a dumbfounded expression . </p>
<p>“No matter how strong you are, those are high-level Dungeon’s magic beasts!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo ignored the fiery protest coming from the woman behind him and slowly walked towards the ice bear . </p>
<p>‘Hmm, if I used a dagger…’</p>
<p>The spilt blood would mess up his clothes .  Jinwoo had summoned the two daggers out of habit but quickly returned them to the inventory .  Instead, the man clenched his fists . </p>
<p>‘I know I said I would just watch, but the situation’s different now . I’m sure they’ll understand . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo met the gaze of the ice bear . </p>
<p>Roooaar!</p>
<p>The ice bear swung an arm the size of a tree trunk with a lightning speed . </p>
<p>woosh-!</p>
<p>But its attack struck nothing but air . </p>
<p>‘It’s fast for its size . ’</p>
<p>Having jumped above the bear’s head, Jinwoo realized why it had such a dangerous reputation . </p>
<p>‘Still…’</p>
<p>The level-ups he underwent were not for nothing .  Before the ice bear could raise its head, Jinwoo used all of his strength to punch its forehead . </p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong>.  . </p>
<p>The bear’s head crashed into the ground .  Its skull obliterated, the bear stuck out a tongue and did not move again . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve leveled up!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Alright! Jinwoo felt like he was close to leveling up and realized that it was a good thing that he stopped Park Heejin . </p>
<p>“Who… who the hell are you?”</p>
<p>He turned to face the shaking voice and looked at the four members of his party at a loss for words .  Jinwoo scratched his temple . </p>
<p>‘I thought I made myself clear . ’</p>
<p>Well, they probably forgot after seeing such a shocking scene .  Jinwoo firmly spoke his conditions again,</p>
<p>“Once again, no questions . If you don’t like it, you can go-”</p>
<p>Jinwoo pointed towards the direction Kim Cheol’s team had left in . </p>
<p>“-to them . ”</p>
<p>His words snapped Park Heejin to attention,</p>
<p>“I just saw you kill an ice bear in one hit . I am NOT leaving your side . ”</p>
<p>Her heart was beating fast .  She had instinctively selected Jinwoo over Kim Cheol but now realized just how correct her decision was .  She made a determination after a quick calculation . In order to leave this place alive, she would have to follow Sung Jinwoo .  Before Jinwoo could change his mind, she quickly spoke,</p>
<p>“Jinwoo-ssi, please be our leader . I’ll follow whatever you have say . ”</p>
<p>‘I also said I won’t be accepting any requests…’</p>
<p>After a brief moment, Jinwoo nodded .  When he thought about it, this would probably be the best .  Park Heejin turned around to the rest of the party . Since Han Songyi was brought here by Jinwoo, she probably didn’t need to ask the girl .  And the other two Hunters…</p>
<p>“You two also agree, right?”</p>
<p>Suddenly having the attention focused on them, the two Hunters looked back and forth between the ice bear’s corpse and Jinwoo then vigorously nodded . </p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside of the Red Gate . </p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol wiped away the sweat on his brows and checked the time .  Baek Yoonho asked,</p>
<p>“How long has it been?”</p>
<p>“About three hours . ”</p>
<p>“Three hours… That means three days have passed inside . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho’s voice was heavy .  Of the four gathered here, only Baek Yoonho had actually experienced the Red Gate before .  The man was one of the S-rankers who represented South Korea . Even to a man like him, a Red Gate was not something to be taken lightly .  With a calm heart, he recalled the memory of the time,</p>
<p>“The true terror of Red Gates is the fact that the inside connects to an entirely different world . ”</p>
<p>This was a rare sight: an S-rank Hunter was about to tell his experiences with a Red Gate .  Ahn Sangmin, Joo Sungchan and Hyun Gicheol all perked up in attention . </p>
<p>“Inside the Gate, you could end up in a desert world with temperatures exceeding 140 degrees fahrenheit . Or perhaps it’ll be a jungle world infested with venomous snakes and poisonous insects . Maybe even a tundra world where the tips of your fingers will freeze . ”</p>
<p>gulp . </p>
<p>The three listening gulped as one . </p>
<p>“The problems it that until you’ve entered the Gate, you won’t know that it’s a Red Gate . This means that there is no way of preparing ahead of time . ”</p>
<p>Today was the same .  An ordinary Gate had turned red after the Hunters had entered . </p>
<p>“Whether burning under the blazing sun, hounded by poisonous insects day and night, or frozen in the cold… The weak will be the first to die . ”</p>
<p>“My god…”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol let out a small moan in disbelief . </p>
<p>“And in that harsh environment, you have to face magic beasts . ”</p>
<p>Just hearing the circumstances relayed the dark situation the Hunters were in .  But that was not all . </p>
<p>“And let’s say you somehow managed to get used to the environment . The problem after that is finding sustenance . ”</p>
<p>At the minimum few weeks, at the longest few months .  You had to find your own food in that time . It was not an easy task . </p>
<p>“In the harsh environment made worse by the hunger, the only thing you can rely on is the magic power compass . ”</p>
<p>It was a tool to point toward strong sources of magic power .  Defeating the boss was the only way to leave a Red Gate, outside of letting it undergo a Dungeon Break . </p>
<p>“Imagine looking at that tiny compass and enduring days, weeks or months . Do you think you could keep your sanity?”</p>
<p>The three men shook their heads .  If ordinary non-Hunters like them were thrown into such a place, forget the magic beasts, the environment would kill them in a day . </p>
<p>“You said three days had passed, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>At Hyun Gicheol’s confirmation, Baek Yoonho made a tragic face . </p>
<p>“If it’s been that long, all the Hunters below B-rank are dead . ”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol was an A-ranker .  But no matter how skilled an A-ranker was, it was impossible to protect his entire party in a situation like this .  At the very least, you’d need an S-ranker with them . And so,</p>
<p>“All we can do is pray that the high-rankers come back alive . ”</p>
<p>It was a conclusion born from experience . </p>
<p>In Baek Yoonho’s head, the C-rank Hunters and below were as good as dead . </p>
<p>Back in the Red Gate . </p>
<p>The C-rank Hunters and below were enjoying a feast around a campfire . </p>
<p>On top of the fire, a large piece of meat was being cooked . </p>
<p>“You know this bear meat, it’s a little tough, but it’s not bad . ”</p>
<p>“Would you like some more?”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you . ”</p>
<p>Yoon Gijoong held out a plate and Go Myunghwan cut up some more ice bear meat and placed it on the plate .  These were the two C-rankers of Jinwoo’s party . Park Heejin and Han Songyi also ate their fill of the bear meat . </p>
<p>“Unni, could you pass the pepper?” [1]</p>
<p>“You want the salt as well?”</p>
<p>“No, just the pepper please . ”</p>
<p>Somehow, they all had gotten used to the Dungeon .  Alongside the campfire, they even had tents and blankets for sleeping .  They didn’t exactly have much discomfort . No… In a bizarre way, they were almost feeling cozy, like they were on vacation .  Go Myunghwan looked around and spoke,</p>
<p>“You know, doesn’t it feel like the ice bears have been attacking us less and less lately?”</p>
<p>Park Heejin replied to him,</p>
<p>“Well, it’s because the Raid Leader took care of them . ”</p>
<p>“You know, I don’t know what grudge that man has against ice bears, but whenever I see him looking at one, it’s terrifying . Honestly hope that the Raid Leader never looks at me that way . ”</p>
<p>In no time, Jinwoo’s title among his teammates had turned into “Raid Leader” .  Feeling his absence, Park Heejin look around and asked,</p>
<p>“Where did our dear Raid Leader disappear off to anyways?”</p>
<p>Yoon Gijoong raised his head that was focused on his plate and replied,</p>
<p>“He said he was going to patrol the area . ”</p>
<p>What .  Park Heejin was incredulous . </p>
<p>“To go around a high-level Dungeon on his own… Is he not scared even a little bit?”</p>
<p>Yoon Gijoong smiled widely,</p>
<p>“I think he’ll be alright, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Go Myunghwan added,</p>
<p>“Seriously . The man killed a high-level magic beast with his bare hands . ”</p>
<p>The man continued,</p>
<p>“You know… now that I mention it… Just how high does your rank have to be to kill a magic beast like that with your bare hands?”</p>
<p>A silence fell on the group .  Of course, they were all curious .  But they did not want to break the cardinal rule of their group even when Jinwoo was absent . </p>
<p>“ . Let’s just keep eating . ”</p>
<p>At Park Heejin’s words, everyone nodded . </p>
<p>Jinwoo was combing the forest and walked through a bush . </p>
<p>‘It was around here somewhere…’</p>
<p>He felt the presence of multiple ice bears from somewhere .  He had been tracking their den since last night . He had started this after realizing that the attacking bears were all coming from the same direction .  Walking all over the area, Jinwoo’s eyes suddenly sparkled . </p>
<p>‘Found them!’</p>
<p>Across the thicket, he saw dozens of caves .  In each cave, he felt more than one presence .  Well, he didn’t need to use the sense stat . Just before him, many ice bears were entering and leaving the caves .  At a rough count, there were about 30 of them . It was truly a den of bears . </p>
<p>The corners of Jinwoo’s mouth rose .  He had purposely came alone . </p>
<p>This would be the prime opportunity . </p>
<p>They had been waiting . </p>
<p>This would be their inaugural battle . </p>
<p>‘Come forth . ’</p>
<p>Responding to his thoughts, soldiers clad in black armor soundlessly appeared from his shadow and stood behind him . </p>
<p>“You know this is your first battle, right?”</p>
<p>As people had first impressions between each other, your first battle will determine my impression of you .  Is what he meant . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>The Shadow Soldiers stood shoulder to shoulder . </p>
<p>Good . </p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled widely . </p>
<p>sniff sniff</p>
<p>The ice bears caught a whiff of Jinwoo and slowly started coming out of their caves . </p>
<p>‘Looks like they’re also ready . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo pointed a hand toward the ice bears . </p>
<p>“Go . ”</p>
<p>At his command, the Shadow Soldiers slid across the land toward the enemy . </p>
<p> .  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Unni” (언니): Lit . “Older Sister” . Surprised it took this long for this word to appear . Yet another ultra common title in the Korean language . This one is used by females to refer to older females of a relatively close age .  Basically the female equivalent of “hyung”</p>
