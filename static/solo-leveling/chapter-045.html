<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 45</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin bowed his head once more, then quickly call over to Hyun Gicheol . </p>
<p>“Deputy Hyun, grab the contract and the seals[1] . ”</p>
<p>“Yessir!”</p>
<p>The man finished his preparations in an instant .  As the two men quickly left the office, Baek Yoonho asked an employee standing nearby,</p>
<p>“What just happened? Just what kind of a recruit is it, that Chief Ahn moved like that?”</p>
<p>The man he asked turned to a female coworker for help, but she shook her head . </p>
<p>I don’t know either .  Her eyes told him . </p>
<p>‘Sigh…’</p>
<p>Flustered, the man scratched the back of his head and spoke with difficulty,</p>
<p>“Er… That’s… I’m not sure…”</p>
<p>He expected the wrath of the Guildmaster to come down upon him next, but the Guildmaster did not say anything . </p>
<p>‘He’s even hiding it from his subordinates, is that it?’</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho put a hand on his chin .  One of the crucial pieces that built Baekho to what it was today was Chief Ahn Sangmin .  And if such a man was this focused on his task…</p>
<p>‘Did our Chief Ahn come across something big?’</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho’s lips widened to a bright smile . </p>
<p>‘What kind of coffee is this bitter?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo scrunched his face .  Compared to a can of coffee from a vending machine, this “espresso” he had ordered tasted more like a medicine .  On top of that, it was so expensive . </p>
<p>‘You know how many canned coffees I could buy with six thousand won…?’</p>
<p>As he considered how much sugar he would have to add to get it to the level of a canned coffee, Ahn Sangmin and Hyun Gicheol entered the cafe . </p>
<p>“Over here . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo waved his hand . </p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin and Hyun Gicheol discovered Jinwoo after looking around the shop and smiled .  They looked like they were about to win big on some lottery . </p>
<p>“We didn’t think we’d see you again so soon . ”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin greeted Jinwoo and sat across from him .  His subordinate sat down next to the division chief . Jinwoo greeted them with a light nod of the head .  They say to strike while the iron’s hot; Ahn Sangmin immediately began to take out the contract as he sat down . </p>
<p>“So first, we’ll go over the contractual conditions-”</p>
<p>The man’s eagerness was blinding, but Jinwoo firmly cut him off,</p>
<p>“I’m not here for a contract today . ”</p>
<p>The hand that was taking out the contract froze .  Hyun Gicheol’s expression equally hardened . </p>
<p>As if someone had pressed a pause button on his life, Ahn Sangmin spoke while his hands were still frozen on the half-revealed documents,</p>
<p>“Then what business do you have with the Baekho Guild…?”</p>
<p>As his expectations were large, so was his disappointment .  The new recruit that had approached them of his own will rejected the contract as soon as he saw it .  It couldn’t have been that he changed his mind in that instant . </p>
<p>“I’m here to help you both . ”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Both of the Baekho employees reacted in the same way .  The pair looked at each other, then back at Jinwoo . Jinwoo continued at the confused pair,</p>
<p>“You told me that because our side was taking up all the C-rank Gates, you were having some issues with new recruit training, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right . Even if we don’t have a C-rank Gate, we can’t exactly take new recruits into a higher level Dungeon . ”</p>
<p>“And that’s why I’m here . ”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin was confused,</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t follow…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo decided he had teased them enough and got to the point,</p>
<p>“We currently have three C-rank Gates reserved . I’d like to sell the raiding rights to the Baekho Guild . ”</p>
<p>Ah~</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol opened his mouth in understanding .  The two men from Baekho finally understood why Jinwoo was here .  Ahn Sangmin put away the contract and asked,</p>
<p>“If you wanted to help us, wouldn’t it have been better to just not reserve them in the first place?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo shook his head,</p>
<p>“We have a need to reserve a lot of C-rank Gates for a while . ”</p>
<p>“Then why today…?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled widely,</p>
<p>“Well, I wanted to help you two out . ”</p>
<p>Should they believe him? Ahn Sangmin started to run all sorts of possibilities in his head, but Jinwoo continued,</p>
<p>“Of course, this offer is only for today . We can’t put it off forever after all . If you miss this offer, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for you to reserve a C-rank Gate for a while . ”</p>
<p>It was the way home shopping channel salesmen would speak when a sale was about to expire . </p>
<p>‘Hmm…’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin fell into contemplation .  It wasn’t as if Gates only appeared in the capitol area .  If they became desperate, they could go to other regions to train their new recruits .  However, such a method might invite complaint from that region’s Guilds or private parties .  Not only that, doing so would give off a hint of weakness to the other top Guilds . They would basically be announcing that they did not have the power to train their new recruits in their own territory . </p>
<p>‘Hmm… That would be disgraceful . ’</p>
<p>It was the truth .  What kind of a recruit would want to enter a Guild that was belittled by the other top Guilds? This is why a Guild’s image was important . </p>
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>After giving it some thought, Ahn Sangmin made a decision . </p>
<p>“We’ll buy the raiding rights . Three C-rank Gates should just be enough for us . How much for all of them?”</p>
<p>Baekho Guild certainly had the funds to fight for the Gates going forward .  But it would neither be worth it to get into a battle of finances against Yoojin Construction nor sour their relationship with Jinwoo .  So if Jinwoo was offering to turn over the Gates, shouldn’t they be thankful?</p>
<p>They were not thankful for his asking price . </p>
<p>“How about three hundred million per Gate, so nine hundred million total?”</p>
<p>“Huk!”</p>
<p>Both of the employees made a same noise . </p>
<p>“That’s a little-”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol started to protest, but Ahn Sangmin quickly stopped him .  This was just like their first meeting . Back then, Jinwoo ended the discussion after Baekho was unable to meet his asking price .  They could not miss an opportunity like this . If they did, it would become very difficult to reserve a C-rank Gate in the area . Worst case scenario, they would have to go to the other regions to train their new recruits . </p>
<p>‘I’ll atleast have to try a counteroffer . ’</p>
<p>It was too early to end the negotiations .  Still, 300 million for a single Gate was too much .  According to their recent investigation, Yoo Jinho’s team bought the Gates for 100 million each .  Jinwoo was asking for 3 times that amount . Ahn Sangmin was sure Jinwoo knew as much . </p>
<p>‘He probably gave a high number, expecting us to negotiate it down . ’</p>
<p>The division chief remembered his Guildmaster’s words as he left the office . </p>
<p>“I don’t care if it’s one hundred or two hundred million, reserve a damn Gate! Do you understand?!”</p>
<p>This was as good as receiving permission from the company president .  Since the rest of the Second Management Division heard the same thing, the Guildmaster would probably not retract his words .  Ahn Sangmin gulped and gave a counteroffer,</p>
<p>“Three hundred is a bit hard for us, how about two hund-”</p>
<p>“Works for me . ”</p>
<p>Before Ahn Sangmin even finished, Jinwoo held out a hand .  Ahn Sangmin took the hand, flustered . </p>
<p>“So… so we’re in agreement?”</p>
<p>“Yes, two hundred million per C-rank Gate . Please put it into this account . ”</p>
<p>It felt like the negotiation was over too quickly, but Ahn Sangmin was still glad .  The man shook Jinwoo’s hand and bowed his head . </p>
<p>“Thank you very much . ”</p>
<p>“It was nothing . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was smiling widely .  Ahn Sangmin thought that he had scored some small victory here .  He had solved the issue of new recruit training and furthered the Guild’s relationship with Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘A transaction like this is the first step to building faith . ’</p>
<p>Yes .  Step by step, he would build a good relationship with Jinwoo .  Eventually, he’ll come over to their side . People did not spit in the face of someone smiling at them, nor did they ignore a present that was given .  In his heart, Ahn Sangmin pumped his fists in accomplishment . </p>
<p>Jinwoo was the first to rise . </p>
<p>“Then, I’ll see you again someday . Ah, I forgot, here-”</p>
<p>Jinwoo held out a shopping bag with a tumbler in it and returned it to its owner</p>
<p>“Thank you for that . It was delicious . ”</p>
<p>“I’m glad it was to your tastes . ”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol took the shopping bag, and Jinwoo left the cafe . </p>
<p>After walking some distance away from the Baekho’s employees, Jinwoo called Yoo Jinho .  The young man answered the call with a surprised voice,</p>
<p>- “Hyungnim, the funds really came in . Six hundred million?”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo silently laughed .  The transaction was a success .  He managed to sell the raiding rights that would’ve been thrown away for twice what they paid .  It was an incredible deal . Yoo Jinho asked with awe in his voice,</p>
<p>- “Hyungnim, just how did you pull this off? Where did you sell the C-rank Gates?”</p>
<p>“It’s a trade secret . ”</p>
<p>- “Eh?”</p>
<p>“Rest well, I’ll see you in two days . ”</p>
<p>While Yoo Jinho was flustered, Jinwoo hung up . </p>
<p>That night . </p>
<p>The Second Management Division office . </p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol frantically looked for Ahn Sangmin . </p>
<p>“Chief! Chief!”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin turned away from his computer .  Hyun Gicheol held out his phone with a panicked expression . </p>
<p>“Look at this!”</p>
<p>“Just what is it?”</p>
<p>Looking at the phone screen, Ahn Sangmin’s eyes narrowed . </p>
<p>‘This is…?’</p>
<p>It was the Hunter Association’s website available only for Hunters .  The website revealed the information on Gates that had appeared . The phone was specifically in the real-time raiding rights reservation section . </p>
<p>“What the?! There are plenty of C-rank Gates in our area!”</p>
<p>“I know! And most of them were reserved for less than ten million!”</p>
<p>“Wait… Are you telling me…”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin dreaded Hyun Gicheol’s next words,</p>
<p>“Yoo Jinho’s team didn’t reserve any Gates today . ”</p>
<p>He then recalled Jinwoo’s words from the first phone call they had . </p>
<p>“I’ll have some free time on Thursday . ”</p>
<p>Tomorrow was that Thursday . </p>
<p>From the start, Yoo Jinho’s team had no plans to Raid tomorrow .  Ahn Sangmin had forgotten about this and purchased the raiding rights for an expensive price . </p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin groaned .  The facts were all there, but he failed to put them together .  It was a grave mistake . Well, that mistake managed to calm the wrath of the Guildmaster . </p>
<p>“I think he got us, chief . ”</p>
<p>As if on cue, Ahn Sangmin received a message . </p>
<p>beep beep</p>
<p>It was Sung Jinwoo . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Looks like we’re even now . I’ll forget about the spying business with this . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Ha ha ha, the man’s not to be underestimated . ’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin swallowed a laughter .  If Jinwoo really meant to overlook the spying, Ahn Sangmin did not feel bad at all about being tricked .  Their final objective was to recruit Jinwoo, after all . The amount that they spent today was nothing for Baekho . </p>
<p>“Let’s just consider it an investment into Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>If only they could gain something worthy from their investment .  Ahn Sangmin looked at the message with a smile then put away his phone . </p>
<p>After sending the message, Jinwoo looked around the surrounding . </p>
<p>There was no one around . </p>
<p>He was in the middle of a forest . </p>
<p>To plan for all possibilities, he had chosen a secluded place . </p>
<p>The time was 5:44 PM .  There would be no one hiking at this hour .  Just in case, he had still picked a place far away from any hiking trails . </p>
<p>‘Shall I get started?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo opened the System’s message box . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Class Advancement Quest has arrived . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to accept? (Y/N)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As if waiting for him, the message appeared in front of his eyes . </p>
