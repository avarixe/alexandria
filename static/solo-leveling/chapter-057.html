<p>"Look at this, it's pathetic, it's pathetic . ". </p>
<p>Yoo Jin-ho laughed at the expression of mimicking his brother in the same way </p>
<p>"I do not feel like joking right now . ". "Pathetic, 쯧쯧 . ". "Oh, stop it!". </p>
<p>The two of them were like old friends Yoo Soo-hyun stood in front of Yoo Jin-ho </p>
<p>"Why are you doing that?". "What am I doing?". "I was awakened, I was awake, and I can not beat the public?". "So? You want me to punch you?". "That's not what it is . ". </p>
<p>Yoo Soo-hyun asked her pretty lips What would be the punishment of my father when Yu Jin-ho fisted to his eldest brother?. I imagined it was horrible I do not understand the feeling of Yu Jin-ho, who should be suffering . Yoo Soo-hyun went to the place where Yu Jin-sung disappeared </p>
<p>"No matter how unlucky I am, that human being . ". </p>
<p>It was her that she hated Yu Jin-ho's brother as much as Yu-Jin Ho It was one of the few people who knew the real face of Eugeneong hidden under a smart expression However, Yu Jin-ho did not agree It is not because of brother I wanted to win my brother in front of him, not in a ghost story like this Yoo Jin-ho was shutting his mouth, Yoo-hyun carefully asked </p>
<p>"Hey . Is the plan still valid?". "Huh?". "I am going to become a guild master </p>
<p>Yoo Jin-ho smiled instead of the answer Who told you?. I'm glad you do not laugh . Your confrontation with your brother However, thanks to my big brother, I got a lot of possibilities </p>
<p>'If you secure a master license . '. </p>
<p>I had to fight No, I could win Yoo Hyun, who saw the resolute eye of Yoo Jin-ho, put both hands on his waist and said firmly </p>
<p>"Even if I die, I will not go under that person . I do not want to fight with your father " . Thanks . ". </p>
<p>This was Yoo Soo-hyun's support system A hunter with a high rating called A Rank from a popular child actor Except for the background of the chaebol 's girl, Yoo had a lot of guilds staring at him like stars However, Yoo Soo-hyun rejected all offerings and has been doing model activities for a while But now, a proposal that has been difficult to reject has come It is the founding member of Eugene guild It was the famous president's instructions I can not ignore the words of my great father, but I do not want to go under Yujin Yoo Soo-hyun also had many troubles I do not mind, but I have to hang on to the hope of Yu Jin-ho Woo Woo-woo -. Yoo asked me to listen to the ringing sound of Yu Jin - ho 's pocket </p>
<p>"Do not answer the phone?". "Ah . ". </p>
<p>Yoo Jin-ho, who had been doing something for a while, picked up the phone late The number on the liquid crystal was unfamiliar </p>
<p>_brother. </p>
<p>The expression of Yu Jin-ho who confirmed the caller brightened instantly </p>
<p>"Yes, brother!". </p>
<p>I received a phone call </p>
<p>"Yes, yes, my brother . No, I can go . Yeah, I'll be right back, brother . ". </p>
<p>Yoo Jin-ho hang up the phone like that Yoo Soo-hyun showed interest in the atmosphere of Yu Jin-ho changed 180 degrees </p>
<p>"What is it?. </p>
<p>But I did not have time to explain it freely here It's not your brother's request!. I just wanted to get out of here </p>
<p>"Talk to you later!". </p>
<p>Yoo had a headache when he saw the back of Yu Jin-ho rushing in a hurry </p>
<p>"Why are you so excited?". </p>
<p>Yu Jin-ho at the time of family gathering always had a shoulder hanging around, but today it was different </p>
<p>" . It's a good thing . ". </p>
<p>Yoo Soo-hyun thinks that he should ask after all On the other hand, Yu Jin-ho looked for his father Soon evening My family and relatives could not leave without my father's permission at mealtime Yoo Jin-ho, who has looked around I found a father who is talking to people away The tiger face A hard personality that does not show a smile at all My father was always a difficult opponent </p>
<p>'I have not even said anything yet . '. </p>
<p>I was already nervous But I had to show courage </p>
<p>'I promised you . '. </p>
<p>Yoo Jin-ho took a deep breath and slowly walked to his father I do not know how many times I wanted to turn around on the way However, I put up with it Yoo Jin-ho barely reached the famous front </p>
<p>"father . ". </p>
<p>It was a considerable distance between me and my son The famous gaze moved to Yujin </p>
<p>"What's going on?". </p>
<p>People who were famous in the unusual atmosphere went off at the same time as promised </p>
<p>"Father, can I come out for a second?". </p>
<p>Yoo Jin-ho's voice against his father was unbelievable </p>
<p>"Well, I'll be back until evening time . ". " . ". </p>
<p>The famous singer who stood with a look like a hit-and-run hit sighs and reluctantly gave permission </p>
<p>" . come and go . ". </p>
<p>Yujin bowed his head with a bright face </p>
<p>"Thank you, Father . ". </p>
<p>And he flew away His wife came to the famous who was staring at the back of Yu-Jin Ho with his firm face </p>
<p>"Honey, I came in from Vienna . ". </p>
<p>It was news that I was waiting Famous showed interest </p>
<p>"What are the results of the competition?". "I won the championship </p>
<p>A faint smile on the face of the famous But soon when I wanted to do it, I hid myself </p>
<p>"Well, when do you think Korea will come?". "Throughout the semester, I am busy without a bird, so I can come at any time during my vacation . ". </p>
<p>The famous frowned </p>
<p>"No matter how busy I am, Grandpa said," Do not let go . ". "You too, these days, the children are so serious about sacrifices . ". "쯧쯧 . ". </p>
<p>She gave me a tie of a famous tie that was a little disheveled, and said it with fondness </p>
<p>"And why do not you take care of Jinho too?". "And the sound . the tiger needs to take care of the tiger cub, not the kitten . ". "I am a child of a tiger and a cat, and I am your child . ". "Hmm . ". "Do you know that?" Jinho first laughed in front of you since he graduated from middle school . ". </p>
<p>Did you?. The famous gaze of Lee Jae Ho was fixed in the direction of disappearing Yu Jin But that too The famous seemed to be a minority </p>
<p>"It looks like you have a girlfriend </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Hunter Association Headquarters in Guro-gu, Seoul An employee who was checking the machine stopped in front of the small horsepower gauge </p>
<p>"What is this?". </p>
<p>The number that should be stopped at zero was repeating the up and down It seemed totally delicious But it seemed like it was a big deal . It was not uncommon to break down as much as it was a precision machine </p>
<p>"Kim . ". "Yeah . ". </p>
<p>My subordinates ran </p>
<p>"How many gates are there with this?". "What's the number?". "N-1744B . ". </p>
<p>The subordinate who nodded his head looked at the journal </p>
<p>"I went to seven places . ". "Today? Look at me . ". </p>
<p>It was really I had exactly seven places, and four of them were closed to the hunters </p>
<p>"Did not you have any trouble at the gate with this?". "Yes, I do not have much to say . ". "Yes?". </p>
<p>The employee scratched the jaw with its beard gleaming If the original horsepower finds an error, all the gauges measured by that meter are immediately canceled It was a matter of course What would happen to the hunters if they were class A or B in fact knowing that they were class C?. I can never get out safely A higher grade dungeon is such a place As the boundaries between the higher Hunter and the lower Hunter are clear, the difference between the upper and lower dungeons was great If you do not have a large dungeon, do you have a large guild dedicated to the task </p>
<p>'Do I have to announce it now?'. </p>
<p>It's not difficult to tell However, opposition from the team that obtained the license is also a repulsion, and if it takes time to re-measure it, it will not be possible to condemn it on the day when the dungeon breaks If you go wrong, your throat may fly </p>
<p>'How did the Hunter Association come in . '. </p>
<p>The Hunter Society was receiving public sector treatment To join the company, you should make efforts similar to the notifications When I thought I lost my job, my eyes were dark </p>
<p>'No, no . '. </p>
<p>He shook his head My subordinates have also noticed what their troubles are So I asked carefully </p>
<p>"This is . what should I do?". "Hmm . ". </p>
<p>It has been two days already Would not it have already popped if the problem would have blown up?. </p>
<p>"Let's leave it alone . ". "Is that so, though?". "Well, what's the big deal? It's been two days . ". "I do . ". </p>
<p>My subordinates also turned their head off </p>
<p>"The report says that the N-1744B is strange until yesterday "Okay . ". </p>
<p>. ***. </p>
<p>. Ahn Sang-min of the second management department of Baekho guild Ahn Sang - min, who was cutting the wave, stopped shining and started to straighten his waist Cricket -. </p>
<p>"Ego . ". </p>
<p>Today's menu is miso stew As a single man in the eighth year of his life, he has mastered dishes that have already been outstanding The instrument was five years ago I just filled up the food with instant food . I found the person who was getting tired . I decided to learn how to cook to live, and now the food on the TV can be made bigger But Did the tuning end at all?. As the skill grew, the dishes on the table became more and more simple home side dishes Like the miso soup of the day </p>
<p>"Cute, this taste . ". </p>
<p>Ahn Sang-min, who had tasted a spoonful, nodded his head as if he had admired his skills There is only one person who can taste this taste I was deeply saddened </p>
<p>'Would you like to have a meal invitation?'. </p>
<p>There was one face of the subordinate who appeared at the moment, but soon he shook his head I'm tired of hearing the old bastard </p>
<p>'I do not know if you're doing well . '. </p>
<p>He's a smart guy, and he has a nasty corner somewhere </p>
<p>'Oh, what company do you think at home?'. </p>
<p>Let's eat rice Ahn Sang - min moved his miso pot to a table in the living room and called a hum It was a routine to eat dinner alone watching TV set in the living room The kitchen table was too big and lonely for a man to eat alone Beep I sat on the TV with the remote control The news was coming out </p>
<p>[Today's breaking news . ]. </p>
<p>One of the few advantages of single life is that you do not have to fight a channel with someone When I turn on the TV, I see the channel I always watch Ahn Sang-min walked out of the LCD screen of a large TV on the wall and ran a spoonful of rice </p>
<p>[ . the US Hunter Bureau in Washington caused a mysterious explosion that shocked the entire United States . Some of the rumors about whether or not the talks between S-class hunters have been triggered . [. </p>
<p>"Enough . ending, ending . ". </p>
<p>Ahn sangmin carefully searched the side dish to announce the start of the meal while squealing his tongue with a sad expression There were not many types of side dish </p>
<p>'The beginning is Kimchi . '. </p>
<p>[ . It is a video shot on the CCTV near the bureau . Suddenly the crack of the outer wall of the building began to crack . ]. </p>
<p>I posted a cool kimchi that I had just taken from the Kimchi refrigerator on the hot rice cooked with a spoonful what I said in the news Then the moment I tried to go to the mouth, the phone rang loudly </p>
<p>'Ah! Who else, again . '. </p>
<p>Ahn Sang-min was grumbling, picking up his cell phone, and hurriedly received a call when he saw the caller </p>
<p>"Yes, it is Ahn Sang-min . ". </p>
<p>The person who called was Jinwoo Ahn Sang-min received a phone call with a bright face By the way The expression of Ahn Sang-min, who heard the story of Jin-woo, became increasingly bewildered </p>
<p>"Yes? Can you take a tour of the Hunter training site?". </p>
