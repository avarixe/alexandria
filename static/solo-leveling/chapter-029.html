<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 29</p>
<p>It was difficult to continue dodging with his body in so much pain, but Jinwoo could not miss the timing of his next move .  If he lost consciousness now, it would be all over . </p>
<p>‘…178, 179, 180!’</p>
<p>Having waited out the 3-minute timer on Cerberus’ buff, Jinwoo activated the trump card he had prepared before the fight . </p>
<p>‘Accept Reward 1!’</p>
<p>He had purposely held on to the first reward of his daily quest, specifically for an occasion like this . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Reward 1 . Status Recovery has been accepted . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>wooosh!</p>
<p>A blue light covered his body and completely restored his health . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Health: 3,602 / 3,602</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>His injured shoulder and arm also became healed . </p>
<p>‘This is my chance!’</p>
<p>At the shoulder-to-shoulder distance the two maintained, even Cerberus, with all of his agility, could not dodge Jinwoo’s next move .  Having recovered all his strength and stamina, Jinwoo deftly maneuvered around the Cerberus’ heads, putting it in a headlock with his left arm; it was the same maneuver he used against Casaka . </p>
<p>With his right arm, Jinwoo began to mercilessly stab the center of the beast’s neck repeatedly . </p>
<p>Stab! Stab! Stab! </p>
<p>Having ended its enraged state, Cerberus felt the pain and thrashed around, trying to loosen Jinwoo from its back . </p>
<p>yelp! whimper! whimper!</p>
<p>Just as before, Jinwoo held on with all his strength .  As the Cerberus whipped back and forth, he tightened the grip on its neck and continued to stab . </p>
<p>Stab! Stab! Stab! </p>
<p>The beast continued to whimper in pain and tried desperately to bite Jinwoo, but the fight was over at this point . </p>
<p>Stab! Stab!</p>
<p>The Casaka’s Poisoned Fang moved past the beast’s throat and toward its heart . </p>
<p>Stab! Stab! Stab!</p>
<p>The light of struggle in Cerberus’ eyes began to fade . </p>
<p>whimper…</p>
<p>Finally, the beast’s heads went limp . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>

<p>Jinwoo had leveled up four times in one go .  It was that difficult of a fight . Jinwoo made sure the beast’s life was completely snuffed out before letting go of its neck .  The Cerberus’ body slumped onto the ground lifelessly . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>Jinwoo bent over with hands on his knees . </p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>He let out a sigh of relief .  To think that he would face a monster that could use a skill .  If it wasn’t for the trump card he had prepared, he would be the one on the ground right now .  Thinking about this made Jinwoo shudder . </p>
<p>‘Ah… items…’</p>
<p>What kind of drops would he obtain after all this work?</p>
<p>Jinwoo sighed once more and stretched a hand out toward the corpse . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Whoa . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was jubilant . </p>
<p>‘Increase agility and sense stats by twenty points?’</p>
<p>The necklace’s stats were amazing, fitting of an A-rank item .  It was the highest-ranking equipment he had seen so far . </p>
<p>‘Makes sense after that fight…’</p>
<p>If anything, he would’ve been mad if the rarity on it was low .  However, taking a closer look at the necklace, Jinwoo hesitated .  A round gold band with soft tipped spikes jutting around it, it was clearly a dog collar . </p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Having contemplated putting it on with closed eyes, Jinwoo relented and moved it towards his neck .  A message appeared in response . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to equip the “Gatekeeper’s Necklace”?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He hesitated again . </p>
<p>“…Sure . ”</p>
<p>Then the necklace slowly disappeared from his hands . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The “Gatekeeper’s Necklace” has been equipped . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong> </strong>. </p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly opened his stat screen . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 60</p>
<p>Constitution: 39</p>
<p>Agility: 80</p>
<p>Intelligence: 37</p>
<p><strong>Sense: 67</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>(Available stat points: 0)</strong>.   </p>
<p>Physical Damage Reduction: 20%</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Oh, whoa!”</p>
<p>His agility and sense stats were raised by 20 points .  The necklace’s stats had been applied to him . He felt around his neck, confirming that the necklace wasn’t there .  It seemed that equipping items through the System did not necessarily put them on him physically . He was relieved that he would not have to walk around wearing a dog collar . </p>
<p>‘Next, the molars . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo opened up the shop .  Each of the molars were sold for 150 thousand gold .  Having sold 3 molars, Jinwoo had collected 450 thousand pieces of gold . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Current Gold: 562,362</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘What kind of junk item is this expensive?’</p>
<p>His first fight had given him an idea of the difficulty of this Dungeon .  The Demon Castle would not be a pushover . But this was not a bad news to Jinwoo .  Just taking down one monster gave him four times the amount of gold he had earned in his first Instant Dungeon .  At this rate, he would surely be able to afford some of the top tier items from the System’s shop . </p>
<p>‘As long as I can clear this place…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked up at the tower on fire . </p>
<p>flare!</p>
<p>The top of the tower was obscured by a strange fog .  The only way to see what was on top would be to climb the tower from the inside .  Jinwoo shook his head at the thought . </p>
<p>‘No . It’s too early for me . ’</p>
<p>After all, he had only barely managed to defeat the Gatekeeper, and that was with the title buff and the trick using the daily quest’s reward .  There was no knowing what waited beyond the gates . For now, it was time to retreat . </p>
<p>Still, one thing was for sure . </p>
<p>The Demon Castle Key was indeed something that he wanted .  The description of the Blessed Random Box was not wrong . Level-up, items and even gold, all that he wanted could be found in this place .  Once he had the power, he would be able to obtain it all . </p>
<p>Just not today . </p>
<p>Regretfully, Jinwoo put away the key back into the inventory . </p>
<p>‘I’ll be back . ’</p>
<p>It was a promise that he would keep . </p>
<p>Jinwoo turned back with a smile on his face . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<p></p>
<p>-3 . Coincidence-</p>
<p>The next few days went by without incidence .  Yoo Jinho kept calling him on a daily basis to check with his status . </p>
<p>-“Hyungnim! It’s me, Yoo Jinho . ”</p>
<p>“Make it short . ”</p>
<p>-“Yes, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>The young man told him that he was diligently working on getting together a team .  The raiding party would be completed shortly, so he repeatedly asked Jinwoo to wait just a little longer . </p>
<p>‘He must be scared that I might back out . ’</p>
<p>But there was no way that Jinwoo would wait idly while Yoo Jinho completed his task .  So today, like the past few days, Jinwoo went on the Hunter website . He had continuously checked the job boards, but as expected, there were no private Raids that were accepting an E-rank Hunter .  His run in with Hwang Dongseok was luck . Even if the bastard had nefarious plans in mind, it still meant that Jinwoo was able to go on a private Raid . </p>
<p>‘Thankfully, I was able to earn some money, level-up and even get a new skill . ’</p>
<p>Wait, was he actually thanking Hwang Dongseok?</p>
<p>Jinwoo groaned .  Still, even if it was with more lizards[1], he wanted to get back into a Dungeon . </p>
<p>Can’t get into a private Raid, no calls from the Association, and no keys from daily quests . </p>
<p>Jinwoo hated wasting time like this . </p>
<p>growl…</p>
<p>‘Is it already time to eat?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stepped away from browsing the job boards and went over to the kitchen . </p>
<p>The fridge was empty . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He had been distracted by so many things lately and had forgotten to go shopping . </p>
<p>‘Guess I’ll go do that today . ’</p>
<p>He closed the fridge with a yawn . </p>
<p>One of the few benefits of his worn-down apartment was that it was close to a large grocery store .  Jinwoo changed into something comfortable and went outside . It took him 10 minutes of walking to reach the store .  </p>
<p>The large interior of the store greeted him as he walked in .  Since there was no sale going on, there were less people around than usual .  Jinwoo grabbed a basket and started walking down the aisles . Having become the man of the house after his mother fell ill, going grocery shopping was a routine experience for Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Nothing’s really catching my eyes . ’</p>
<p>He stared at the ingredients while thinking about dinner . </p>
<p>“Young man, is your body feeling better?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned around towards the friendly voice . </p>
<p>‘Who?’</p>
<p>Due to his high sense stat, he knew that there was another Hunter nearby, but since the grocery store was a place where a lot of people, including Hunters, would be shopping at, he had not paid it much mind .  He did not expect that Hunter to actually speak to him, but it was someone that he knew . </p>
<p>“Song-ssi ahjussi?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo greeted him with welcome . </p>
<p>Song-ssi ahjussi, aka Song Chiyeol, looked at Jinwoo with a mix of surprise and happiness . </p>
<p>“I had heard that you were alright, but looking at you now, I can’t believe it . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol was awed by just how fast Jinwoo had recovered .  Embarrassed at the man’s staring, Jinwoo scratched his temples .  Song Chiyeol continued,</p>
<p>“I should’ve gone to see you myself, but those bastards at the Association, I don’t know what they were thinking, put a moratorium on the incident, and I had no way of reaching you . I believe Ms . Juhee was also dying to hear about you . ”</p>
<p>“Juhee-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Yep . She said she would retire, but still went to last week’s Raid to catch a glimpse of you . ”</p>
<p>“Last week…?”</p>
<p>Hearing Song-ssi ahjussi’s explanation, Jinwoo learned that the day he went on a Raid with Hwang Dongseok’s team was also the day an Association Raid had taken place . </p>
<p>‘No wonder the Association’s been quiet . ’</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they weren’t contacting him, but rather, he had missed them on that one day .  A small mystery cleared up for Jinwoo . </p>
<p>Song Chiyeol continued to observe Jinwoo’s figure with an amazed look . </p>
<p>‘Was Sung-ssi always this big? His leg should be still…’</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol’s gaze fell to Jinwoo’s lower half .  His eyes widened . </p>
<p>“Young man… is your leg…?”</p>
<p>  . </p>
