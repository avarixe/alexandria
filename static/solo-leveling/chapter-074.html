<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 74</p>
<p>‘The upper floors are a different level . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo recalled the first and only boss of the Demon Castle he had fought, the Overlord of the Lower Floors, Volkhan of Avarice .  The bastard’s title was the “Overlord of the Lower Floors” . After going above the 50th Floor where the demon was, the difficulty of each floor increased rapidly .  Before, he was able to climb 10 floors a day, 20 on a good one . Now, he was barely able to clear 7~8 floors a day . </p>
<p>Jinwoo was currently on the 74th Floor .  The normal mobs here were the top-level demons and occasionally archdemons .  They were in a different class than the demons from the lower floors . </p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>A top-level demon size of a two story building fell with a tanto sticking out of its chest . </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo removed Baruka’s Tanto from the fallen demon’s chest .  It was the last enemy of the latest group . Another battle was won .  The victorious Shadow Soldiers all gathered before Jinwoo . He looked over his army .  It was impossible for the undead army, but Jinwoo swore his soldiers actually looked tired .  That was how tough the monsters were on the upper floors . Thankfully, an archdemon was not involved in the battle just now, so it was relatively easier than the others . </p>
<p>‘Each of those damned things are boss-class . ’</p>
<p>This was not a conclusion made idly .  The description of the Marble of Avarice indicated that Volkhan himself was an archdemon .  While Volkhan may have been the boss of the lower floors, the archdemons were just normal monsters on the upper floors .  After the 70th Floor, they started appearing more and more commonly . </p>
<p>‘If it was just the monsters getting stronger, I can manage it…’</p>
<p>But there was a bigger problem .  It was the change in the environment in the upper floors .  Starting with the 51st Floor, the city was on fire . The fires became stronger with each floor .  After the 70th Floor, the heat became strong enough to shave away at his health . Just moving his body a little bit increased his fatigue greatly . </p>
<p>Not a “Demon Castle” but a “Tower on Fire” .  That feeling he had before entering the place was on the mark . </p>
<p>‘ . Let’s leave . ’</p>
<p>He would end his Raid here .  He needed a way to deal with the heat of the flames . </p>
<p>‘I need to obtain an artifact that can increase my resistance against fire-type magic . ’</p>
<p>The equipment used by high-ranking Hunters were incredibly expensive .  On top of that, if they were enchanted with protective magic, it would be doubly so .  He recalled seeing on the news that the some of the more expensive items cost tens of billions of won .  While he had earned quite a bit of real money while raiding with Yoo Jinho, Jinwoo wasn’t sure if it would be enough to buy the artifacts he needed .  So he needed an insurance,</p>
<p>‘This should be good enough . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked at the Marble of Avarice in his inventory and smiled .  Any Mage-class Hunter would drool at the sight of such an item . What would happen if he put the marble up for auction? If its effects were proven, the high-ranking Mage-Class Hunters would line-up at the door .  Jinwoo closed the inventory . </p>
<p>His goal in this Dungeon was to level-up .  He had achieved that goal wonderfully . He did not feel any shame in putting off the Raid for the future .  However, one thing lingered in his mind . He raised his head . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Collected Demon Souls: 9,624 / 10,000</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Only 400 souls go to . ’</p>
<p>Just a little more, and he could finish the quest .  Today was the 6th day . One more day would be more than enough to collect the remaining souls .  A silver lining of the upper floors was the existence of demons that gave multiple souls . 400 could be collected in a flash . </p>
<p>‘Let’s leave after finishing the quest . ’</p>
<p>With that determination, Jinwoo headed forward .  Because he had a solid goal in mind, there was more strength in his steps . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Floors 1 through 74 are open . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Which floor would you like to go to?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>In the middle of the magic circle, Jinwoo spoke,</p>
<p>“75th Floor . ”</p>
<p>What was this unexpected boon?</p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the monster guarding the interfloor movement magic circle in the distance . </p>
<p>‘The Guide of Souls, Metus’ [1]</p>
<p>Looking at the name, it was clear that it was a boss-class monster .  The monster was clad in a black robe, wearing a silver necklace . </p>
<p>‘And that must be the Monarch of Demons’ Necklace . ’</p>
<p>In his path to just complete the quest and leave, he had unexpectedly come across the next piece of the set items .  However, the reason why Jinwoo was smiling was not because of the item . No matter how good the drops were, you couldn’t obtain them if you couldn’t kill the monster .  Jinwoo smiled as he realized there was something critically different about this monster that would help him kill it . The Hunter held his two daggers in his hands and ran forward .  The skeleton mage clad in black robes discovered him . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Guide of Souls, Metus has noticed an intruder!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As expected of a boss-class monster, Metus completed its spell in an instant .  A blood-red magic circle appeared at its feet and a gloomy energy gathered around it . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Guide of Souls, Metus has used ‘Cursed Voice’ . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Receiving Metus’s calling, an undead army rose from the ground . </p>
<p>Their numbers were in the thousands!</p>
<p>A normal person would’ve suffocated just looking at this terrifying army, but Jinwoo was not phased in any capacity . </p>
<p>‘As I thought…’</p>
<p>He had predicted this .  Out of the entire Demon Castle, this was the first place he saw that familiar black smoke rising from the ground .  Looking at the strange phenomenon, it was easy for Jinwoo to tell what kind of a monster Metus was . </p>
<p>‘The Guide of Souls . ’</p>
<p>The boss’s title only added onto his suspicions . </p>
<p>And as expected, Metus had called forth a powerful undead army .  However, in that area of expertise, Jinwoo had the strongest class . </p>
<p>“ARISE!!!”</p>
<p>UWAAAAAH-!</p>
<p>With a piercing scream of pain, soldiers rose from the shadows of Metus’s undead army .  </p>
<p>Their numbers were in the hundreds! [2]</p>
<p>It was a greatly lacking to Metus’ army, but it was more than enough .  The ones doing the job would be his real army . </p>
<p>“Make me a path!”</p>
<p>And here was the real army .  The pitch-black soldiers rising out of Jinwoo’s shadow .  The hundreds of soldiers made from Shadow Extraction distracted Metus’s army .  Meanwhile, the members of Jinwoo’s real army, having leveled up together with their master while clearing the Demon Castle, cleared a path for Jinwoo . </p>
<p>There was only one target!</p>
<p>Ygritte and Iron took the vanguard and cut down the undead with an incredible speed .  The distance between Jinwoo and Metus had shortened in an instant . </p>
<p>‘This is good enough . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo ran ahead of his knights . </p>
<p>‘Sprint!’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>‘Sprint’ has leveled up!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Having used it to run all over the Demon Castle, ‘Sprint’ leveled up . </p>
<p>‘Good . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled widely .  Having escaped the encirclement of the undead army in a flash, Jinwoo stood before Metus .  The two commanders of the undead met each other’s gazes . </p>
<p>‘Didn’t expect this, did you?’</p>
<p>While the light of victory filled Jinwoo’s eyes, Metus’s shoulders jumped at the sight of Jinwoo .  At least, that’s what it looked like . </p>
<p>‘Do monsters feel fear?’</p>
<p>Well, this was not a moment to think of such things .  The flashing daggers moved with such speed that they created dozens of afterimages . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>The boss-class monster fell without a fight .  Jinwoo knew through his experiences that mage-class monsters that commanded minions were incredibly weak at one-on-one combat .  He knew this from the moment he laid eyes on Metus . The Hunter returned his weapons to the inventory . </p>

<p>A smile bloomed on Jinwoo’s face . </p>
<p>‘Not many left now . ’</p>

<p>“76th Floor . ”</p>
<p>Eastern Seaboard, United States . </p>
<p>A sleeping man struggled like he was in a nightmare, then awoke with a start .  It was Hwang Dongsoo . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was the white ceiling .  In an unfamiliar environment, the man looked left and right . </p>
<p>“A… hospital?”</p>
<p>Dream . </p>
<p>Was it not a dream?</p>
<p>When Hwang Dongsoo wiped away a streak of sweat beneath his chin with the back of his hand, he discovered something .  On top of the hospital gown, an IV needle was stuck to his hand . The man’s face hardened . A cold voice came out of his mouth,</p>
<p>“Just say what you’re here for and go . ”</p>
<p>The Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Hunters (FBH) stood across the room .  He was a middle-aged american with more whites in his hair than black . The man slowly approached Hwang Dongsoo . </p>
<p>“I had something I wanted to ask you, so I was waiting here . ”</p>
<p>What did he want to ask? Hwang Dongsoo raised his head .  The deputy director met his gaze and spoke,</p>
<p>“That man, Sung Ilhwan… Are you really sure he’s a magic beast?”</p>
<p>“Do you think I attacked an ordinary person?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t believe you . I just wanted to confirm what I saw with my eyes . ”</p>
<p>The deputy director handed the Hunter his phone .  A video was playing . </p>
<p>“What is this…?”</p>
<p>“It’s a security footage from that day . ”</p>
<p>In the video, an asian man was rescuing FBH employees from the collapsing building .  Hwang Dongsoo did not need to ask who the man was . How could he forget? It was the last face he saw before losing consciousness, Sung Ilhwan .  The deputy director continued with a darkened expression,</p>
<p>“I’ve… never heard of a magic beast that helped humans . Are you still certain that that man is a magic beast?”</p>
<p>“ . He’s most certainly a magic beast . ”</p>
<p>“Is that so . ”</p>
<p>The deputy director put away his phone,</p>
<p>“Once you’re discharged, come to the FBH, there are few things we need to put on record . ”</p>
<p>As the deputy director turned around to leave, Hwang Dongsoo asked,</p>
<p>“What happened to that man?”</p>
<p>“He disappeared after fighting you . While the bureau’s working hard to track him down, we’re not sure if we can get someone who was able to defeat you…”</p>
<p>Before leaving, the deputy director asked one more question with difficulty,</p>
<p>“Do you… by any chance know of a place he might go to?”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Watching the Hunter close his mouth with a finality, the deputy director headed out of the hospital room .  The moment the man left, Hwang Dongsoo ripped out the IV needle from his arm . </p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongsoo combed through his memories . </p>
<p>It was a humiliating defeat . </p>
<p>Before he realized what was happening, Sung Ilhwan’s foot was on his neck .  He was sprawled out on the floor like a weakling . While he was coughing, Sung Ilhwan spoke to him,</p>
<p>“Do not take a step into Korea . This is for your benefit, not my son’s . If you do, you will not be able to rest even in death . ”</p>
<p>And he couldn’t remember anything after that .  When he had opened his eyes, he was here . </p>
<p>‘I won’t be able to rest even in death?’</p>
<p>What did that mean? Was it a threat that he would be viciously killed?</p>
<p>‘You dare… threaten me?’</p>
<p>Hwang Dongsoo’s fists trembled . It was humiliating enough that he lost to a magic beast, but to think that he would be further disgraced by a threat . </p>
<p>‘I know where he’s going . ’</p>
<p>He will kill that thing . </p>
<p>But how? Whether or not he truly was a magic beast, Sung Ilhwan was undeniably strong . </p>
<p>‘I need a proper gear to take him down . ’</p>
<p>Fortunately, it would be easy to obtain such gear . </p>
<p>‘I’ll call the Guild . ’</p>
<p>The Guild Hwang Dongsoo belonged to, Scavenger, was one of the top Guilds across the entire world .  Just the value of the artifacts owned by Scavenger was greater than a small country’s budget . </p>
<p>‘It won’t be a problem as long as I can borrow few artifacts . ’ [3]</p>
<p>Hwang Dongsoo’s eyes flickered with a powerful light . </p>
<p>To Korea . </p>
<p>The man decided on his next objective . </p>

The possibility had plagued his mind ever since that time .  He wasn’t sure if that item was even a possibility here but decided to try . </p>

<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Guide of Souls, Metus” (망령의 인도자 메투스): pretty straightforward . “souls/spirits” 망령 + “guide” 인도자 + proper name (meh 메 too 투 ss 스) . </p>
<p>[2]: “Their numbers were in the hundreds!”: I know he gained a ton of levels (and intelligence points correspondingly), but I didn’t expect his Shadow Extraction limit to increase by this much… Nothing else in the passage indicates that this is some special occurrence . Not sure if it’s plot-hole or rule-of-cool, but Jinwoo apparently can raise hundreds of soldiers through Shadow Extraction now . Shrug . OR, since all the other stats are weighted (i . e . gaining 1 point from 100 to 101 strength gives far more benefit than going from 10 to 11), maybe intelligence is the same (i . e . gaining 1 point from 109 to 110 gives far more Shadow limits than going from 50 to 51) . </p>
<p>[3]: Just a small reminder all the way back from the first arc, but “artifacts” are what people call magic items (tools/equipment/gear) from Dungeons . </p>
