<h3>Chapter 232: Chapter 232</h3> <p>His heightened emotion was all-too-clear to see on Chairman Yu’s face </p>
<p>Regardless of what he wanted to say, it shouldn’t be discussed here . Jin-Woo remembered his mom and little sister, and took a quick look towards the dining table, before shifting his gaze back to Chairman Yu </p>
<p>“…”. </p>
<p>The older man was anxiously waiting for Jin-Woo’s reply . After a short deliberation, the latter’s lips finally parted open </p>
<p>“If it’s somewhere private to quietly talk, then, well… . ”. </p>
<p>Chairman Yu’s expression brightened and a genuine smile quickly formed on his face </p>
<p>“Allow me to guide you to such a place . Shall we get going, then?”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo went back inside the apartment and told his mom that he’d be out for a bit, put on his coat, and made his way down to the lobby of the building while being accompanied by Chairman Yu and his entourage </p>
<p>And as expected, the front entrance of the building was occupied by the reporters that had set up a camp there . Most likely, the three well-built young men were Chairman Yu’s bodyguards here to overcome the wall of the reporters </p>
<p>As for those said reporters, they were far too busy shouting out angrily while pushing and shoving against the Monitoring Division’s Hunters protecting the entrance </p>
<p>“What the hell?? How can this make sense? It’s fine for the Chairman of Yujin Construction, but we aren’t allowed to go inside?!”. </p>
<p>“He’s a guest coming to visit Hunter Seong Jin-Woo? Why can’t reporters be guests, too?! We’re also guests from now on!! We’re guests!!”. </p>
<p>“Aaah, is that so? The biggest financial supporter of the Hunter’s Association is okay, but reporters are not, is that it?!”. </p>
<p>The reporters crazily pushed and shoved forwards as if they were planning to stampede past the wall of humans were it not for them being Hunters and not regular people </p>
<p>“Step aside!!”. </p>
<p>Things were so bad that the Hunters of the Monitoring Division looked rather pitiable right now </p>
<p>“Didn’t Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim announce that he won’t do any interviews?!”. </p>
<p>“Hey, over there! Step back!!”. </p>
<p>“If you wish to visit Hunter-nim’s residence, you must go and obtain a permit from the Association first!!”. </p>
<p>Since they were up against regular people, they couldn’t resort to using their real strengths, so the agents from the Monitoring Division could only sweat profusely under the current circumstances . Jin-Woo studied them with sympathetic eyes and eventually, extended his hands out </p>
<p>“Uh, uh-uh??”. </p>
<p>The reporters began floating up into the air </p>
<p>“S-save me!”. </p>
<p>This time, forget about ten centimetres, Jin-Woo lifted the reporters ten metres up in the air . When he stepped outside the entrance, Hunters quickly bowed their heads to welcome him </p>
<p>“Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim!”. </p>
<p>“Hunter-nim!”. </p>
<p>Compared to these Hunters who didn’t get too surprised by what was happening – as if they were familiar with this whole thing already – the eyes of Chairman Yu and his three bodyguards went extra round from the sheer unbridled shock </p>
<p>“O-oh, my god… . ”. </p>
<p>The businessman’s gaze was fixed to the reporter helplessly flailing in the air . He could see their complexion paling greatly, too . For the first time ever, Chairman Yu felt sorry for these people, even though he often times felt sick and tired of dealing with them in the past </p>
<p>The person in charge of this batch of the Monitoring Division’s agents walked over to Jin-Woo and although there was a troubled expression on his face, his lips began forming a smile, as well </p>
<p>“Hunter-nim… If you keep doing this, it’s going to come and bite us in the rear later . ”. </p>
<p>“Well, they were getting a bit too noisy to be left alone, you see . ”. </p>
<p>“Haha . ”. </p>
<p>The reporters were continuously shouting something out, but even before anyone had noticed it, a barrier made out of magical energy was surrounding them to cut off all sounds made by their mouths </p>
<p>The person in charge looked up at them for a little while, before asking Jin-Woo </p>
<p>“How long will you keep them up there this time?”. </p>
<p>“I’m thinking about something like five minutes, so that they can cool their heads up there . ”. </p>
<p>The Hunters from the Monitoring Division burst out in laughter after hearing his declaration to rewrite the existing record </p>
<p>Wahahahah-!. </p>
<p>“Hey! Hush!”. </p>
<p>The person in charge did his best to suppress his own laughter and chided his subordinates before replying politely back to Jin-Woo </p>
<p>“I pray that you make sure no reporters are harmed today . ”. </p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about that . ”. </p>
<p>It’s been a while since he had become a master in ‘Ruler’s Authority’, or the technique to move Mana to influence an object . Even if he wasn’t here, the Mana would safely lower the reporters at a later time </p>
<p>‘Nothing I can do about them feeling a bit sick, though…’. </p>
<p>However, not only did they try to barge into his home even though his private details were being protected, they even tried to raise a huge ruckus as well, so this level of a warning shouldn’t pose a problem at all </p>
<p>Screech </p>
<p>Soon, the waiting limousine Chairman Yu brought along came to a stop before them, and both him and Jin-Woo climbed into the back seat </p>
<p>The vehicle smoothly glided forward and headed off to Chairman Yu’s private residence </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Chairman Yu guided Jin-Woo to the drawing room of his mansion, which should probably be the quietest place they could talk in . They settled down on the couches while facing each other </p>
<p>“I’d like not to be interrupted during my chat with Seong Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>“Understood, Chairman . ”. </p>
<p>After he sent away everyone near their vicinity, Jin-Woo broke the ice first </p>
<p>“How did you find out?”. </p>
<p>There shouldn’t have been any evidence of him helping Chairman Yu out . So, where could he have made a mistake? As Jin-Woo stared with a curious gaze, Chairman Yu began telling him the truth of what happened </p>
<p>“My daughter saw you leaving the hospital on that day . ”. </p>
<p>If it was Chairman Yu’s daughter, then… </p>
<p>‘Ah . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo recalled Yu Jin-Ho’s older sister, the one he ran into in front of his Guild office . He thought that she looked kinda familiar back then . But to think, she was the same person as the one he walked past in front of the hospital that Chairman Yu Myung-Hwan had been admitted to </p>
<p>Realising that the actions he thought were watertight had been undone by a simple coincidence, Jin-Woo could only form a helpless smile </p>
<p>At the same time, Chairman Yu was carefully studying Jin-Woo’s expression, and after seeing that smile, he felt greatly relieved </p>
<p>‘What a relief . ’. </p>
<p>Even if the deed was done out of goodwill, Jin-Woo tried to hide it so Yu Myung-Hwan was inwardly worried that the young Hunter would get angry at him for exposing the secret like this . He wouldn’t even be able to look the other party in the eye if he somehow ended up displeasing his life’s saviour </p>
<p>Thankfully, contrary to his worries, Jin-Woo didn’t look unhappy at all . Indeed, what a wonderful turn of events this was for Chairman Yu </p>
<p>“As I expected, it was you, Seong Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>“Yes, it was . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn’t try to deny it </p>
<p>The moment he heard the answer straight from the person, Chairman Yu’s eyes, locked onto Jin-Woo, shook about greatly </p>
<p>Up until now, he lost count of just how many people had tried to get in his good books because they wanted something from him . Some of them didn’t even bother to put in any effort whatsoever and simply reached out, hoping to get a hand-out somehow </p>
<p>But then, what about this young man before his eyes?. </p>
<p>He saved a person’s life . No, he saved the life of the top executive of the biggest corporation in the country, yet he wasn’t asking for anything in return </p>
<p>If Chairman Yu’s daughter didn’t see him and simply walked on by, he would never have found out how he recovered from that illness for the rest of his life </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Hwan was famous for being a poker face, but just this once, his expression betrayed how emotionally moved he was </p>
<p>“But, why… . ?”. </p>
<p>He had to say something in order to suppress his overwhelming emotions </p>
<p>“Why did you help me?”. </p>
<p>Back then, even though the demand for a helping hand was made, accompanied by a huge financial incentive, Jin-Woo simply rejected it while saying that he didn’t possess such powers </p>
<p>So, what made him change his mind, then?. </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Hwan brought Jin-Woo here pretty much to ask that one question, even at the risk of offending him </p>
<p>Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump… </p>
<p>His heart was beating faster and faster as time went by; every passing second felt as long as ten minutes before Jin-Woo chose to make his reply </p>
<p>And that he finally did </p>
<p>“I judged you to be a trustworthy person, that was why . ”. </p>
<p>“… . !!”. </p>
<p>At that rather unexpected answer, Chairman Yu’s brows rose up higher </p>
<p>“But… . What does that mean?”. </p>
<p>“If you were the type of person who did whatever it takes to accomplish your goal, then I wouldn’t even have considered risking it for your sake . ”. </p>
<p>“By that, you mean… . Is it because I never tried to use my son, Jin-Ho?”. </p>
<p>“That’s correct . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo nodded his head </p>
<p>As expected of the leader of a global corporation, Chairman Yu instantly figured out what Jin-Woo was trying to say here </p>
<p>It was true that Yu Myung-Hwan did possess the one trump card that could have made Jin-Woo act . And that would be his son, the Vice-Chair of the Ah-Jin Guild – Yu Jin-Ho </p>
<p>However, after his proposal was rejected, he didn’t obsessively cling on and cleanly backed away . Meaning, he believed in Jin-Woo’s words of not possessing the cure </p>
<p>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth – Jin-Woo religiously adhered to this principle so, to Yu Myung-Hwan who believed in him, he replied in kind as well </p>
<p>Although, it did take a bit of time to figure out whether the businessman was worthy of his trust or not </p>
<p>‘Still, I didn’t make a wrong decision . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo formed a grin </p>
<p>At the same time…. </p>
<p>Drip… </p>
<p>A single teardrop trickled down Yu Myung-Hwan’s eye </p>
<p>“I’m not sure how to express my gratitude to you . ”. </p>
<p>He quickly wiped the tear away with the back of his hand and stared at the young Hunter with a determined expression on his face </p>
<p>“Please, allow me to repay this debt, even if it’s only half, no, half of that half . I beg of you . ”. </p>
<p>Only by doing this, the debt of gratitude he felt in his heart would lessen just a tad . Yu Myung-Hwan quickly carried on </p>
<p>“Is there anything you’d like, Hunter-nim?”. </p>
<p>“It’s not that I want something, but… . ”. </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Hwan’s ears perked up right away . If Hunter Seong Jin-Woo wanted money or something else, he was planning to do everything in his power to make it happen </p>
<p>However, Jin-Woo’s answer was a bit different to what Yu Myung-Hwan had been thinking of </p>
<p>“If something ever happens to me… . Can you look after my mother and my sister?”. </p>
<p>That was his reply after a short bout of hesitation </p>
<p>To prepare for the worst-possible-case scenario that may or may not happen, Jin-Woo asked for the favour of his family being taken good care of . He may have already amassed enough money, but unfortunately, money wouldn’t be able to protect them from certain things </p>
<p>Surely, Chairman Yu Myung-Hwan would prove to be a dependable buffer during those times </p>
<p>“… . Are you really okay with only that, Hunter-nim?”. </p>
<p>“Yes, I am . ”. </p>
<p>It was difficult to imagine something untoward happening to Hunter Seong Jin-Woo, but since he decided to say yes to whatever demand the young man would make, Chairman Yu Myung-Hwan didn’t even hesitate and nodded his head right away </p>
<p>“I give you my word . ”. </p>
<p>The lengthy conversation had come to an end here </p>
<p>“Well, then… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo tried to get up to leave </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Hwan watched him and felt rueful about the fact that their conversation had come to an end . He then belatedly realised how much he liked this young man named Jin-Woo </p>
<p>If Hunter Seong Jin-Woo could become a part of his family… ?. </p>
<p>Never once did Yu Myung-Hwan entertain the idea of using his beloved daughter as a tool in an arranged marriage, but he still found himself asking the question anyway </p>
<p>“By any chance, are you dating someone at the moment?”. </p>
<p>If it was this young man, then he’d not feel short-changed by giving away Yu Jin-Hui – for the first time ever, Yu Myung-Hwan had met a young man who made him feel this way </p>
<p>Too bad, though, Jin-Woo grinned brightly as his reply </p>
<p>“Actually, there is someone I like . ”. </p>
<p>“Oh… . ”. </p>
<p>It was then, Yu Myung-Hwan realised that he just asked a really embarrassing question and his face reddened visibly </p>
<p>That was how impressive this young man was </p>
<p>However, Chairman Yu wasn’t someone who’d obsess over things he couldn’t obtain . He soon raised his head back up and with a smile on his face, bade him goodbye </p>
<p>“I shall pray that the promise I made today won’t ever come true in the future . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo smiled in reply and stood up fully from his seat </p>
<p>“I’ll do my best to make sure of that, too . ”. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Now that all of his Stat values had reached their maximum attainable limit, the only area left to improve was his ability to command his Shadow Army </p>
<p>Jin-Woo returned to the entry prohibited area in Japan in order to get his final preparation ready </p>
<p>The uninhabited sea of forest stretched on forever in his view </p>
<p>Grand-Marshal Bellion had split the Shadow Army to three separate groups as per Jin-Woo’s instruction and assigned the commands of each to himself, Igrit, and Beru </p>
<p>Jin-Woo nodded his head while looking at the three separate groups of his soldiers below the hill . He guessed from the aura emitted by the soldiers below that a great deal of thought had been given to creating the balance of strengths between the three groups </p>
<p>The Grand-Marshal bowed his head after meeting Jin-Woo’s gaze . It seemed that this guy was also the perfectionist-type like Igrit </p>
<p>On the other hand… </p>
<p>‘This guy… . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo turned around to take a gander at the so-called ‘lodging’ built on the summit of the hill </p>
<p>“Beru, get over here . Now . ”. </p>
<p>Whoooosh-!!. </p>
<p>Beru dashed forward from the bottom of the hill right up to the summit in the blink of an eye and knelt down before Jin-Woo </p>
<p>“Oh, my king!”. </p>
<p>“Head, floor . ”. </p>
<p>Even before those words finished coming out of his king’s mouth, Beru quickly rammed his head on the ground . Right away, Jin-Woo yelled out </p>
<p>“How can you call this a small ‘shelter’? Am I supposed to take a break inside that?! Setting aside its size, is this even a shelter, to begin with?!”. </p>
<p>“Kiiehhk… . ”. </p>
<p>Beru cowered from Jin-Woo’s loud shouting and replied with the voice of a guy being wrongfully accused </p>
<p>“For a lodging befitting my king, at the bare minimum, it must be… . ”. </p>
<p>“… ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo slowly massaged his forehead . He had completely overlooked the small fact that ants specialised in building ‘houses’ </p>
<p>Indeed, he should’ve seen just what the human-sized ants possessing greater physical strength than superhumans might end up creating in the name of a mere ‘house’ </p>
<p>He slowly raised his lowered face and ended up being overwhelmed by the dignified air of the so-called ‘small shelter’ once more </p>
<p>A massively-tall fortress built out of white stone – so it could be spotted pretty easily from afar – stretched from this part of the land all the way to over there . It was also dizzyingly tall that, while trying to see where its roof was, his neck actually began aching instead from looking up for too long </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s head pulsed painfully again after witnessing the fruit of the ants’ unnecessary devotion . He didn’t even order them to do this, yet here they were </p>
<p>He roughly massaged his temples before groaning out and asked another question </p>
<p>“What about that black flag flapping around at the end of this castle… . That, just what were you thinking when putting that up there??”. </p>
<p>It was then, Bellion hurriedly ran to where his master was and suddenly planted his head on the ground alongside Beru </p>
<p>Boom!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was rendered speechless for a while and alternated his dazed gaze between Bellion and Beru . He slowly turned around and shouted out </p>
<p>“My soldiers! Now, commence with the combat drill!”. </p>
<p>With that, the thunderous roars of the Shadow Soldiers powerfully reverberated throughout the land </p>
<p>Waaaaaaaaaaahhhh-!!!. </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 232 &gt; Fin </p>
