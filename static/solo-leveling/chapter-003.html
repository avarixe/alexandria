<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 3</p>
<p>Her pale face shocked Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?”</p>
<p>“Over… over there . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo followed Juhee’s pointing fingers to the Statue of God .  The enormous statue . She was pointing at its face . Not seeing any difference from the first time he saw it, Jinwoo tilted his head . </p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>With a shaking voice, Juhee spoke,</p>
<p>“H-his eyes… The Statue’s eyes just looked at us . ”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>No matter how long he stared, the results were the same .  The Statue sat still, unmoving . </p>
<p>“Hmm… You must’ve imagined it . ”</p>
<p>But his words fell on deaf ears .  Casting her gaze to the ground, Juhee simply held on to his arms and trembled . </p>
<p>‘Wait . ’</p>
<p>A sense of dread washed over Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘ . Where did the sound go?’</p>
<p>The crackling sound from the torches’ fires suddenly became silent . </p>
<p>“First . ”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr . Song’s reading of the tablet continued . </p>
<p>“Worship the Lord .  Second, Praise the Lord .  Third, Prove your Faith to the Lord .  Those who do not follow these commands will not leave alive . ”</p>
<p>It was in that moment,</p>
<p>creak~</p>
<p>At the sudden sound, all the Hunters jumped in surprise . </p>
<p>“What’s happening?!”</p>
<p>The first person to notice was Jinwoo .  Having focused on his hearing because of the torches, he was able to immediately notice what was happening . </p>
<p>“The door! The door is closing!”</p>
<p>At his words, the entire party turned towards the door, only to watch it close with a bang . </p>
<p>“Dammit! I can’t do this anymore!”</p>
<p>The Hunter who first voted “no” to enter the Double Dungeon swore and headed towards the door . </p>
<p>“I’m leaving now .  You guys can have all the bosses and treasures you want . ”</p>
<p>Glaring rebelliously at Mr . Song, the man turned and grabbed the door’s handles . </p>
<p>Suddenly . </p>
<p>Mr . Song’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>“No, don’t!”</p>
<p>Crunch!</p>
<p>A sickening sound of ‘something’ striking ‘something’ rang throughout the temple . </p>
<p>With it, the man’s head had disappeared from sight .  Having lost its head, his body naturally fell backwards onto the ground . </p>
<p>thud-</p>
<p>The Hunters started screaming . </p>
<p>Having obliterated the man’s head with its mace, the statue returned and assumed its position next to the door as if nothing had happened . </p>
<p>“That- that thing just moved!”</p>
<p>“What? Does that mean all the statues here can move?”</p>
<p>“We’re supposed to fight those?!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t even see him swing that mace!”</p>
<p>It was at this point Jinwoo replayed Juhee’s words in his mind . </p>
<p>“H-his eyes… The Statue’s eyes just looked at us . ”</p>
<p>‘If that’s true…’</p>
<p>He shuddered .  Making an effort to move his terrified body, he turned and looked at the Statue of God . </p>
<p>And found the Statue of God looking back at him . </p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo realized .  This was just the beginning . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<p></p>
<p>-3 . Start of the Attack-</p>
<p>The Statue of God’s eyes were lit with a crimson light .  </p>
<p>Was it a Hunter’s instinct? No, it was the survival instincts of a living being .  “Something” was coming . “Something” that could not be stopped . </p>
<p>Jinwoo turned and shouted on top of his lungs . </p>
<p>“GET DOWN!”</p>
<p>Right as his mouth opened, a crimson ray of light shot out from the Statue’s eyes . </p>
<p>Jinwoo threw himself at Juhee and pulled her to the ground . </p>
<p>BEAM~!</p>
<p>The ray of light passed through where Jinwoo was standing moments before . </p>
<p>1 tenth of a second . </p>
<p>No, 1 hundredth of a second . </p>
<p>If the timing of his actions were off by just an infinitesimal amount…</p>
<p>The other Hunters were not as lucky . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The screams did not come from the Hunters who were struck by the light .  After all, the ones who were struck disintegrated instantly, leaving only a trace of ash and burnt stone in their wake .  No, the screams were coming from the Hunters who survived . </p>
<p>“What the hell is this!”</p>
<p>“Waaaaah!”</p>
<p>“How could this…”</p>
<p>The Hunters were in shock . </p>
<p>11 remaining alive out of 16 . </p>
<p>They had never seen an attack like this before . </p>
<p>‘I barely dodged after hearing Jinwoo . ’</p>
<p>‘If Mr . Sung didn’t shout just now…’</p>
<p>The Hunters looked at Jinwoo and gulped .  Their lives’ savior . If it was not for him, they knew that they would be counted among the fallen . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>With his entire body bowed on the ground, Jinwoo turned his head and peaked at the Statue .  Its eyes were still lit with crimson glow but did not continue its attack . </p>
<p>‘Is… is it done attacking?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his head towards the ground again .  Juhee lay below him, shaking in fear . Although she was a B-Rank Hunter, this was the reason she Hunted in simple Raids under the Association and not an advanced Raid under a large Guild .  </p>
<p>Her breathing became more and more irregular .  He couldn’t just leave her like this . Thinking he had to do something to help her, Jinwoo began to get-up when a strong hand forced him back down . </p>
<p>“Don’t stand up . ”</p>
<p>It was Mr . Song . </p>
<p>Although surprised, Jinwoo sternly listened to his words . </p>
<p>Mr . Song shouted at the other Hunters, as well . </p>
<p>“Everyone stay where you are! Don't move from your position!”</p>
<p>After taking a quick look across the party, Mr . Song turned to Jinwoo again . </p>
<p>“The ones who were moving got hit .  Those that listened to you and got down survived . ”</p>
<p>“I see . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Song tilted his head in confusion . </p>
<p>“Did you not shout after figuring something out?”</p>
<p>“I just felt something dangerous was coming, that’s all…”</p>
<p>Mr . Song’s eyes looked at him with bright eyes . </p>
<p>‘His instincts are good .  I heard he was an E-Rank? If only his abilities were a little higher…’</p>
<p>His gaze turned into one of pity as he continued to stare at Jinwoo .  Meanwhile, Jinwoo got a better look at the man staring at him . What caught his eyes shocked him . </p>
<p>“Ah-ahjussi[1]… your arm…”</p>
<p>“It’s alright, I can endure this much . ”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo gulped .  Mr . Song’s right arm was draped over Jinwoo’s shoulder, and his other arm… His other arm was gone . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>While silently looking at Juhee, Mr . Song wordlessly wrapped the remnants of his shirt around the stump where his arm was, gritting his teeth through the pain . </p>
<p>“Can you tie the end here? Hard to do with just one hand . ”</p>
<p>As Jinwoo nodded and completed what could barely be called first-aid, Mr . Song let out a long sigh .  It was a sigh filled with the experience of 10-years of Hunting . Looking around, he took in the surroundings and the status of their situation .  Just because the Statue of God had stopped its attack didn’t mean their adversity was over . </p>
<p>Time passed as the Hunters lay on the ground . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaah-”</p>
<p>“Why did this happen to us…”</p>
<p>Some of the Hunters started crying again . </p>
<p>“We can’t stay like this forever!”</p>
<p>The patience of the survivors was slowly reaching its limits . </p>
<p>Jinwoo felt the same . </p>
<p>‘We can’t stay like this forever . ’</p>
<p>But what could they do? If Mr . Song’s guess was correct, they would be attacked the moment they started moving .  And even if they managed to dodge the Statue of God’s attack, they still had to go through the statues guarding the door .  And therein lied the other problem . The movement of the one guarding the door was so fast that it could barely be seen by the naked eye . </p>
<p>How could they get past something like that? It was an impossible situation .  The Hunters’ annihilation was simply a matter of time . </p>
<p>‘Wait… a matter of time?’</p>
<p>As the thought appeared in his head, an uncomfortable thought followed . </p>
<p>Something that no one else had noticed . </p>
<p>‘There’s… there’s something we missed . ’</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer was there . </p>
<p>It was in that moment . </p>
<p>“Don’t move!”</p>
<p>Mr . Song yelled at Mr . Joo, who responded by baring his teeth . </p>
<p>“Shut up! We don’t know when that thing will attack again! You just want us to wait until that time?!”</p>
<p>Mr . Joo was a Fighter-class Hunter .  As beings who threw their bodies into the middle of combat, a Fighter-class Hunter’s physical abilities were much greater than an ordinary human .  On top of that, Mr . Joo was someone whose skills were acknowledged by a large Guild, who had offered him a contract . </p>
<p>“I can’t die like this . ”</p>
<p>With his body still lowered to the ground, Mr . Joo flexed the muscles in his legs . </p>
<p>The goal is the door . </p>
<p>With an explosive start, Mr . Joo ran towards the door .  Watching the man’s attempt, Jinwoo turned away and looked back at the Statue of God .  As if waiting, the Statue was looking at Mr . Joo . A ray of light exploded from its eyes . </p>
<p>BEAM~!</p>
<p>The ray covered Mr . Joo’s back . </p>
<p>“Kiyaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>One of the female Hunters screamed .  Unable to control her fear, a yellow puddle slowly appeared from the ground she was collapsed on . </p>
<p>The other Hunter’s faces hardened . </p>
<p>“Oh my god…”</p>
<p>No trace of Mr . Joo could be found where he stood .  Save for two feet on the ground, ending just above the ankles . </p>
<p>The sound of a man retching reached Jinwoo’s ears, and he furrowed his brows . </p>
<p>As expected, this ‘thing’ was more than capable of annihilating all the Hunters in an instant .  To it, it was easier than stepping on an insect . </p>
<p>‘So why… why isn’t it?’</p>
<p>It could kill them all, yet it did not . </p>
<p>Compared to the magic beasts that always threw themselves at the Hunters, these things were different .  Attacking someone only when they moved . Attacking someone only when they neared the door . There was a pattern and condition to their aggression .  Like a game with rules . </p>
<p>‘Perhaps… There are rules to this room?’</p>
<p>In that moment, Jinwoo found a piece of the puzzle in his head .  It was the tablet that Mr . Song was reading earlier . </p>
<p>‘Commandments of the Cartenon Temple’</p>
<p>A commandment was a rule, and rules must be followed . </p>
<p>If there was a way out of this place, away from these things, the key was written on that tablet . </p>
<p>“ . Worship the Lord”</p>
<p>Jinwoo spoke the first commandment out loud . </p>
<p>“Hmm? Did you say something?” Mr . Song asked, facing Jinwoo . </p>
<p>Instead of answering, Jinwoo put a finger to his lips . </p>
<p>‘If I’m correct…”</p>
<p>Slowly, Jinwoo got up .  Mr . Song frantically tried to stop him, but Jinwoo shook his head at him with a determined face . </p>
<p>‘ . That’s not a face that’s given up on living . ’</p>
<p>Mr . Song nodded at Jinwoo .  </p>
<p>Without looking away from the Statue of God, Jinwoo slowly rose and raised his body gradually higher and higher .  Suddenly, the Statue of God’s gaze fell upon him . </p>
<p>BEAM~!</p>
<p>If he hesitated even for a split second on getting back to the ground, Jinwoo would’ve lost a lot more than few strands of hair on his head . </p>
<p>Back on the ground, Jinwoo panted heavily .  </p>
<p>He had almost died just now .  When his eyes met the Statue of God’s, he knew he had looked at death right in the eyes .  Having dodged the attack by a hair (literally), Jinwoo’s legs could not stop shaking . </p>
<p>‘But…’</p>
<p>It was not for naught . </p>
<p>‘He’s not attacking someone who’s moving . ’</p>
<p>Having his body lowered to the ground, no amount of movement caused a reaction from the Statue of God . </p>
<p>‘No, his attacks are towards someone who rises above a certain height . ’</p>
<p>To confirm, he had just put his life on the line .  And now, he had that confirmation . </p>
<p>The meaning of the First Commandment!</p>
