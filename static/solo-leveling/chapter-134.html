<h3>Chapter 134: Chapter 134</h3> 
<p>The moment the ground disappeared and they got sucked into the shadow, Jin-Woo looked at Cha Hae-In falling together at the same time </p>
<p>'As I thought '. </p>
<p>His expectation was on the money </p>
<p>He wondered if the skill 'Shadow Exchange' worked in this manner while using it a few times in the past, and he was right </p>
<p>The identity of the skill 'Shadow Exchange' was actually a 'Gate' . That theory was proven correct when Cha Hae-In travelled alongside him through the shadow </p>
<p>'The entrance is generated below my feet, and the exit is where the determined coordinates are . '. </p>
<p>And those coordinates would be the location of a Shadow Soldier </p>
<p>Even though there was a limitation of the three-hour-long cooldown time, he was still able to create a Gate with this skill . If he wanted to, then wouldn't it be possible for him to move to the other side of the planet every three hours? Jin-Woo unconsciously swallowed his saliva </p>
<p>But, his stunned state lasted only for a brief while longer </p>
<p>His view covered up by the inky darkness reverted back to normal almost right away . And the two of them found themselves inside the Association's gymnasium </p>
<p>The last time he came here, Jin-Woo left behind a shadow just in case he found himself in an urgent need to visit the Association </p>
<p>Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting!. </p>
<p>The overhead lighting system sensed the magic energy from them and the bulbs came on one by one, brightly illuminating the gymnasium's interior . Cha Hae-In opened her eyes after sensing the brightness through her closed eyelids </p>
<p>"But, how . ?!". </p>
<p>Her brows shot up as she failed to hide her astonishment . They were already in a familiar place </p>
<p>She sensed only about one second passing by, yet the surroundings were completely different when she opened her eyes </p>
<p>'How is this even possible?!'. </p>
<p>She had never heard of such a skill existing in the world . Cha Hae-In looked around in utter amazement before shifting her gaze back to Jin-Woo </p>
<p>"You . ". </p>
<p>She had so, so many things she wanted to ask, but in the end, she couldn't open her lips to voice any of them </p>
<p>The first reason for that was because she didn't even know just where to start her questions, and secondly, their distance was far, far too close for a spot of civilised conversation </p>
<p>"It's safe now, so ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo lightly grasped her wrists and unwrapped her arms around his waist </p>
<p>" You don't have to hold on to me anymore . ". </p>
<p>Nod, nod </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In lightly rubbed her wrists he had grasped and wordlessly nodded her head </p>
<p>"Okay . Let's get started . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo walked out of the corner the High Orc Shadow Soldier was probably hiding in, and strode towards the centre of the gymnasium </p>
<p>"Alright . ". </p>
<p>She too followed behind him only to remember that she left her sword back in her car . Although a weapon was an indispensable tool for her trade, it would be quite rude to visit someone else's office fully armed, now wouldn't it?. </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In quickly spoke to him </p>
<p>"I left my weapon back in my car . ". </p>
<p>"Oh, you mean that pickaxe?". </p>
<p>"Excuse me?". </p>
<p>"You know, the one you were carrying around back in the rank A dungeon with High Orcs in it . ". </p>
<p>Her face reddened as soon as she remembered a small detail she'd been wanting to forget </p>
<p>"N-no, my weapon is ". </p>
<p>She then spotted Jin-Woo giggling to himself, and belatedly realised that he was teasing her just now </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo waved his hand after seeing Cha Hae-In's reddened complexion </p>
<p>"I was just joking with you . ". </p>
<p>Time to stop kidding around, however </p>
<p>'Seriously, though . What should I do?'. </p>
<p>Even if it was Cha Hae-In, she wouldn't be able to fight against the soldier he was planning to summon out . Of course, he wanted his soldier to win, but that didn't mean he wanted to see her get hurt, either </p>
<p>"It'll be fine . ". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In shifted her gaze towards the storage located within the gymnasium </p>
<p>"I'm sure there will be a weapon I can borrow in the storage . ". </p>
<p>'Oho . '. </p>
<p>A light gleamed within Jin-Woo's eyes after learning of something new . She walked up to the storage and diagonally swiped her Hunter licence on the electronic lock found on the side of the door </p>
<p>That prompted the storage door to automatically slide open </p>
<p>Rows of not-too-shabby-looking spare weapons were displayed inside the storage . Looking into the interior from a bit of distance away, Jin-Woo was inwardly impressed by the preparedness of the Hunter's Association </p>
<p>'So, there was even stuff like this inside the Association '. </p>
<p>He wondered where all those high taxes Hunters had to fork out over the years ended up, but it looked like they were being put to good use . Cha Hae-In scanned the displayed items before picking up a sword similar in length to the one she'd been using and exited from the storage </p>
<p>"I'm ready . ". </p>
<p>"Will that be fine? It's not a sword you've been using before, so wouldn't it feel off in your hands?". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In shook her head </p>
<p>"It doesn't really matter what weapon it is . Monsters don't care about what weapons Hunters are wielding when they fight us, after all . ". </p>
<p>Those were some wise words </p>
<p>Jin-Woo carried the same opinion as her, so he didn't argue with her there . At the very least, he found her straightforwardness rather likeable </p>
<p>'So, calling out my soldier is next, right?'. </p>
<p>As if to prove that she wasn't joking about being ready, a sharp, focused aura oozed out of her . Against someone like her, any ol' regular soldier would be sliced up into tiny pieces in no time </p>
<p>That's why, Jin-Woo called for the best card he could bring out under the current circumstances </p>
<p>'Come out . '. </p>
<p>A small portion separated from Jin-Woo's shadow and moved away a couple of steps from him . Then a black knight rose up from the unmoving shadow </p>
<p>The jet-black armour and the helm; the red plumage attached to the helm, extending all the way down to his waist . The best sword-wielding Shadow Soldier in his army . It was Igrit </p>
<p>'I told her that I'd be summoning the most powerful guy out, but . '. </p>
<p>But, he thought that calling out Beru was a bit too much . Before he was turned into a Shadow Soldier, Beru was the terrifying creature that nearly drowned the entirety of Korean team members in the pit of pure terror . Hell, even Cha Hae-In herself almost died from his attack, too </p>
<p>Jin-Woo couldn't bring Beru out when considering the potential mental shock she could suffer after seeing him again </p>
<p>As for Fangs, he might end up destroying the gymnasium, so he was excluded . That's why he chose Igrit </p>
<p>'Yup, at the end of the day, it can only be you . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo knew he made the right call when looking at the wide, dependable back of Igrit . But then </p>
<p>"Mister Seong Jin-Woo . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo shifted his gaze over to Cha Hae-In </p>
<p>"What are the conditions for victory and defeat?". </p>
<p>When he heard her icy voice that was cold enough to instantly freeze the listener's heart, his belief began wavering somewhat . Jin-Woo pondered a bit before making his reply </p>
<p>"Either my summon is destroyed, or Cha Hunter-nim admits defeat first . ". </p>
<p>Nod </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In briefly nodded her head . Then, unsheathed the sword she got from the storage </p>
<p>She was only holding a simple, plain magic sword one could buy pretty much anywhere, but even then, the aura oozing out of her was still quite incredible to behold </p>
<p>'Yup, she's definitely strong . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo could sense it . Her surging aura, after she decided to get serious, was definitely fitting for a woman whose skills were rated as the best even among the rank S Hunters </p>
<p>Igrit also unsheathed his sword . As a matter of fact, he was now holding a longsword each in his hands . Even then, Jin-Woo couldn't help but think that Igrit would be defeated by her at this rate </p>
<p>But then </p>
<p>'Wait a sec Didn't she say that it doesn't really matter what weapon it was, right?'. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo recalled what she said just now and a smile floated up on his lips as he asked her for a small favour </p>
<p>"Can you turn around for a second, please?". </p>
<p>" . ?". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In tilted her head for a bit, but didn't complain and turned around as he asked . Using that gap, Jin-Woo summoned the 'Demon King's Longsword' out of his Inventory and handed it over to Igrit </p>
<p>'Use this . '. </p>
<p>By saying that she didn't mind what weapon she used, it could also be interpreted as she didn't mind what weapon her opponent was using </p>
<p>Having been bestowed a sword straight from his sovereign, Igrit tried to kneel down to express his profound gratitude, but Jin-Woo quickly stopped him </p>
<p>'I'm telling you, you don't have to stand on ceremony all the time, you know?'. </p>
<p>If only Iron could learn half of Igrit's attitude . </p>
<p>In any case, the preparation was done, so Jin-Woo called out to Cha Hae-In again </p>
<p>"It's fine now . ". </p>
<p>She turned around and spotted Igit now holding a brand new sword that crackled with blue arcs of electricity . Which he clearly wasn't holding a minute ago </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>"Will it be fine if we start now?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo pretended to not notice anything and asked her if she was good to go </p>
<p>" Yes . ". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In, having already agreed to do this, could only say yes again with a begrudging expression </p>
<p>"Okay then, begin . ". </p>
<p>Soon after Jin-Woo signalled the beginning, Igrit swung the 'Demon King's Longsword' to activate its passive ability as his opening attack </p>
<p>Crack!. </p>
<p>A strand of lightning flew in a straight line at Cha Hae-In . She flinched for the briefest of brief moments . But then, like an agile cat, she bent her upper body back and evaded the lightning </p>
<p>Crackle!!. </p>
<p>The wall of the gymnasium was scorched jet-black after getting struck by the stray lightning </p>
<p>Shudder </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In righted her torso and sent her sharp glare in Jin-Woo's direction, but he averted his gaze to stare into the distance, still pretending to not notice a thing </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>Without saying anything, Cha Hae-In gripped the sword tighter in her hands </p>
<p>It was right then . Igrit rushed towards her at a frightening pace from her front to heed his Sovereign's order to bring her down . However, she didn't even blink once and also flung herself forward towards her opponent </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The office of the Association President, located on the top floor of the main building </p>
<p>One could clearly see not just other Association buildings but the surrounding scenery when sitting inside this office </p>
<p>'Mm?'. </p>
<p>The Association President was in the middle of going through a report, but then, his gaze abruptly shifted over to the window . There should have been no one inside the gymnasium, but the lights there came on just now </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui tilted his head slightly, before picking up his phone to speak to his PA </p>
<p>- "Yes, sir?". </p>
<p>"Did someone book out the gymnasium today?". </p>
<p>- " Sir, I confirmed and no one has booked it today . ". </p>
<p>"Is that so?". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui covered the phone's receiver and organised his thoughts for a bit, before speaking to his subordinate again </p>
<p>"Can you send the CCTV feed from the gymnasium into my office?". </p>
<p>- "Yes, sir . Please hold on . ". </p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the live feed was displayed on the giant TV occupying the entire wall of his office . And that's when he got to see Seong Jin-Woo and Cha Hae-In hugging each other inside the gymnasium </p>
<p>" Keu-hum . ". </p>
<p>Stunned by what he saw, Goh Gun-Hui hurriedly coughed to clear his throat . He looked over and over again, but it was definitely those two . He then tilted his head again </p>
<p>'Did those two people have such a relationship?'. </p>
<p>But then again, the very first person Hunter Cha Hae-In searched for when she regained consciousness briefly inside the helicopter was none other than Hunter Seong Jin-Woo </p>
<p>'It seems that I was very slow on the uptake, huh . '. </p>
<p>A content smile spread on Goh Gun-Hui's face as he gazed at the two young people on the TV screen </p>
<p>Both of them requested for their private information to be protected as soon as they got their rank S licences . Even then, there was not one person in this country who didn't know Cha Hae-In, or for that matter, Seong Jin-Woo </p>
<p>So, if two such people wished to spend some quiet time together, there would be no better place than the Association's gymnasium after the closing time </p>
<p>To think, they'd chose a gymnasium as their date venue, quite unlike the youths of today . What a wonderfully wholesome date this was </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui maintained a heartwarming smile and shook his head wryly </p>
<p>'Yup, being young is indeed wonderful . '. </p>
<p>He reached out to the resting phone's receiver and picked it up once more </p>
<p>"I'm sorry about this, but I want you to switch off all the CCTV feed coming from the gymnasium . ". </p>
<p>- "Sir? But ". </p>
<p>"Just say that today was the maintenance day in the records . ". </p>
<p>- "I understand, sir . ". </p>
<p>The giant TV screen in the President's office showing the CCTV feed switched off as soon as he ended the call . Goh Gun-Hui took one last look at the gymnasium and returned to perusing the report, a grin still etched on his lips </p>
<p>But, it was then </p>
<p>RUMBLE </p>
<p>The surface of the water in his cup vibrated softly as he sensed a minute tremor coming from the gymnasium's direction </p>
<p>"Huhuh . ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui didn't bother to look at the gymnasium and simply carried on smiling </p>
<p>'Indeed, being young is the best . '. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>'This is . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo massaged his aching forehead </p>
<p>It seemed that he had been greatly underestimating Cha Hae-In's actual skills up until now . Igrit's strength had been boosted overall by the 'Demon King's Longsword', but in the end, he couldn't win against her skills </p>
<p>Right after Igrit's left arm flew away from being cut, Jin-Woo ended this match </p>
<p>"Stop!". </p>
<p>Even though they would regenerate back to full, he still couldn't stand the sight of his soldiers getting destroyed </p>
<p>"Fuu- . ". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In reined in her rough breathing and let out a long sigh . Her opponent must've been tougher than expected, because she was soaked in sweat from head to toe . Her slender, white fingers wiped the droplets of sweat forming on her forehead </p>
<p>Jin-Woo looked at that with a rueful expression, inwardly accepting his loss today, and called Igrit back </p>
<p>"It's my loss . ". </p>
<p>Shururuk . </p>
<p>Igrit returned back inside his shadow . However, Cha Hae-In spoke directly to him, her hands not letting go of her sword </p>
<p>"No . Please, this one doesn't count . ". </p>
<p>" . ?". </p>
<p>What did she even mean by that, out of the blue? Didn't count?. </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In explained herself </p>
<p>"Didn't you say that you'd bring out the most powerful summon?". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In walked closer and only stopped when she was one step away from Jin-Woo </p>
<p>"Was that black knight really your strongest summon?". </p>
<p>She wasn't asking him here . No, it sounded as if she was just trying to confirm what she knew already </p>
<p>Jin-Woo quietly shook his head . As if she was waiting for that, Cha Hae-In immediately carried on </p>
<p>"Please call out your strongest summon . We agreed to do from that get-go, didn't we?". </p>
<p>"But, you may get injured . ". </p>
<p>"It's fine . I wanted to fight it at least one more time, anyway . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's eyes widened from her declaration </p>
<p>"Wait, you knew?". </p>
<p>Nod, nod </p>
<p>"I saw the video footage . ". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In had watched the raid video starring Jin-Woo several times by now </p>
<p>The giant monster that made its appearance during the clip – she definitely remembered seeing that monster shooting out the pillar of flames from somewhere </p>
<p>"That summoned creature, that was the High Orc Shaman, the boss of that rank A dungeon . Am I correct?". </p>
<p>If that was the case, then the mutated ant monster he hunted down this time would also have become his summoned creature, as well . From the word go, she chose to go through the test while thinking of fighting that mutated ant </p>
<p>'There is no meaning in a victory like this . '. </p>
<p>She wanted to defeat the summoned creature that used the powers of the mutated ant monster, and thereby get Jin-Woo to acknowledge her true value </p>
<p>He pondered for a little bit, before nodding his head </p>
<p>'Beru' </p>
<p>Right away, a Shadow Soldier enshrouded in jet-black smoke rose up behind Jin-Woo . Cha Hae-In instinctively jumped back and created some distance as soon as she saw Beru's entrance </p>
<p>Back then or now, that guy carried a truly horrendous aura </p>
<p>Jin-Woo got genuinely worried when all colour drained out of her face and quickly asked her </p>
<p>"Will this really be fine?". </p>
<p>Even if Beru had gotten weaker compared to when he was alive, this guy was originally a killing weapon born solely for the purpose of eliminating Hunters </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In's lips were squeezed shut in a straight line, as she weightily nodded her head </p>
<p>Beru had been staring at her quietly for a while, before lowering his head to whisper a question to Jin-Woo </p>
<p>'Oh my king . How should I deal with this female?'. </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In must've been unable to hear what Beru was saying, because she showed no particular reaction at all </p>
<p>'Defeat her without injuring her . '. </p>
<p>'It shall be done . '. </p>
<p>The former king of the ants and the current Shadow Soldier turned towards the deeply tense female warrior </p>
<p>Gulp </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In swallowed her dry saliva . She felt goosebumps break out on her skin from the enormous amount of magic energy emitted by her opponent </p>
<p>'Mister Seong Jin-Woo fought against a creature like this and won??'. </p>
<p>Her eyes that showed no signs of hesitation while fighting against Igrit were now trembling greatly . Beru was done with the necessary preparation to follow his sovereign's order, and suddenly, spat out a mighty screech </p>
<p>Kiiiaaaahhk!!. </p>
<p>Blade-like claws began extending out from the ends of Beru's fingers, so Jin-Woo standing behind him sent over an unhappy glare </p>
<p>'… . Retract the claws . '. </p>
<p>The high-spirited Beru immediately retracted his claws . Jin-Woo drilled one more instruction into his soldier's head </p>
<p>'If you injure that woman, it won't be nice for you, either . Got that?'. </p>
<p>'I shall follow your will . '. </p>
<p>Only after hearing that definite answer from Beru did Jin-Woo declare the start of the second bout </p>
<p>"Begin!". </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 134 &gt; Fin </p>
