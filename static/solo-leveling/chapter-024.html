<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 24</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho placed emphasis on the words, ‘fair price’ . </p>
<p>‘He’s not wrong…’</p>
<p>Jinho’s suggestion would be the best course of option for Jinwoo to safely obtain all the magic cores .  Currently, the ownership of the magic cores was clear . No matter how greedy the man was, Hwang Dongseok could not take them with him to the afterlife .  As such, Yoo Jinho had the legal rights to all the magic cores they carried . And now, the young man was offering it all to Jinwoo . This was different than taking them by force . </p>
<p>‘No reason to turn away good fortune like this…’</p>
<p>After all, if it wasn’t for him, Yoo Jinho would already be dead or taken as hostage .  In that line of thinking, it indeed was the fair price for Jinwoo to obtain all the magic cores . </p>
<p>Watching Jinwoo’s expression soften, Yoo Jinho was sure that he had hit the right mark . </p>
<p>‘As I thought, the magic cores are the price of the blood he spilled taking down Hwang Dongseok’s party . That’s why he won’t refuse them . ’</p>
<p>The two men’s idea of the ‘fair price’ was completely different, but neither of them would realize this . </p>
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>At Jinwoo’s agreement, Yoo Jinho’s face brightened .  The young man felt a little awe at what he perceived to be the Jinwoo’s ironclad conviction .  But then, Jinwoo’s face became cold again . </p>
<p>“But how would I be able to trust you?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo thought back on the initial goal of this conversation .  He did not frighten the young man for a material gain; he just wanted to make sure the events of this Raid would not cause him troubles in the future . </p>
<p>“How could I betray the hyungnim that saved my life multiple times?”</p>
<p>“You could always ignore the promise and go around blabbing your mouth off . ”</p>
<p>Well, it wouldn’t really hurt him in the long run .  Killing Hwang Dongseok’s party was 100% in self-defense .  It was eight armed men versus just him, and they were the ones who attacked first .  With the world’s laws having changed in the advent of Hunters, he would definitely be found not guilty in all of this .  Still, he wanted to avoid all that if he could . For that, he needed Yoo Jinho’s cooperation . </p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo pressed his question and stared .  Yoo Jinho responded with a fierce look in his eyes . </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare do such a cowardly thing! Especially to the savior of my life!”</p>
<p>‘Hmm…’</p>
<p>He realized where he had seen that determined look in Yoo Jinho’s eyes before .  It was the same eyes he defiantly stood up to Hwang Dongseok with . </p>
<p>‘Kid… you’re the real thing, aren’t you?’</p>
<p>Give and Take . </p>
<p>With his life on the line, Yoo Jinho chose to stand with Jinwoo .  Putting his faith in him, the young man was ready to fight eight Hunters .  And so, Jinwoo decided to return some of that faith . </p>
<p>Well… after putting in some final touches . </p>
<p>Jinwoo went over and picked up Hwang Dongseok’s shield . </p>
<p>“You know, I’m still pissed about Hwang Dongseok’s betrayal . ”</p>
<p>Casually turning the shield over in his hands, Jinwoo suddenly threw the shield at the wall . </p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The shield became half embedded into the wall .  Yoo Jinho gulped, and his body began to sweat . </p>
<p>“My dongsaeng[1] won’t betray me like that, would he?”</p>
<p>“Of-of course not, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>The Dungeon shook again, more violently than before . </p>
<p>Shaaaaaake-!!</p>
<p>Alright .  Jinwoo was done teasing the young man .  From the start, he had no plans to hurt Yoo Jinho .  He felt that he had done enough and made his final decision . </p>
<p>“Okay . Go grab their magic cores . We’re leaving the Dungeon . ”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, hyungnim!”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho stood up and bowed his entire upper body, making a 90-degree angle at the waist .  The smile returned to his face . </p>
<p>While Yoo Jinho went around gathering Hwang Dongseok party’s bags with the magic cores, Jinwoo went and picked the pocket of Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>‘Gotta take what’s mine . ’</p>
<p>The contractual wage for today was 2 million .  He was not going to let the man go to the afterlife without paying him .  In Hwang Dongseok’s wallet, he found just a little over 2 million won . He recalled Hwang Dongseok saying he would be paid in cash, right after the Raid; it seemed the man was not lying .  After all, you couldn’t cut off the tail every time . If nothing unusual like the appearance of mana crystals had occurred, they would’ve probably finished the Raid with no trouble . </p>
<p>“Thank you for today’s wages . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo thanked no one in particular, then got up and left .  Yoo Jinho, who had gone to place the Hunters’ magic cores in his bag, panicked when he saw Jinwoo missing after coming back . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim?”</p>
<p>Only the corpses of Jinwoo’s victims were scattered about . </p>
<p>“Aaaaahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Turning blue, Yoo Jinho frantically chased after Jinwoo . </p>
<p></p>
<p>At the scene of the incident, the Association’s investigators and staff had arrived .  The protocol in the case of a death during a Raid was simple . They would have to report the incident to the Association and undergo a brief investigation .  The investigator this time was a strict-looking middle-aged woman . </p>
<p>“Your names?”</p>
<p>“Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>“I’m Yoo Jinho . ”</p>
<p>A Hunter’s death in a Dungeon was unfortunately a common occurrence, so the aftermath investigations were more or less routine .  It was just a matter of keeping proper record of everything that had happened . It would all go smooth… as long as nothing suspicious was noted . </p>
<p>“…Hmm, you’re telling me all the C-rank Hunters died, but you two, a D-rank and an E-rank, got out safely?”</p>
<p>The investigator pushed her glasses up and asked, her eyes narrow . </p>
<p>‘In a normal Raid, the first to die are the weak ones…’</p>
<p>As she carefully looked over the survivors, something caught her eye, and she spoke with a raised voice,</p>
<p>“Oh my!”</p>
<p>She approached Yoo Jinho with sparkles in her eyes . </p>
<p>“Isn’t this one of Maya Company’s new products? The long sword, Kallion? And oh my, this is one of master artisan Gredos’ works, the Royal Series Shields!” [2]</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho put on a proud expression . </p>
<p>“You know your stuff!”</p>
<p>“Hohoho, oh no . I just love looking through new product catalogues . ”</p>
<p>The longsword’s price was 700 million, and the shield was 500 million .  Produced from magic cores worth hundreds of million won and other expensive materials, these were powerful equipment that could raise the level of a D-rank Hunter to C-rank .  A theory of what happened in the Dungeon was created in her head . </p>
<p>‘If it was with these gear…’</p>
<p>A D-ranker just might’ve been able to defeat the boss in a situation where all the C-rankers had died . </p>
<p>‘The E-ranker probably survived by hiding away in some corner . ’</p>
<p>Of course, the truth was completely opposite .  Still, she had made her conclusion . Someone who could afford such gear would not have betrayed his comrades for few paltry pieces of magic cores .  There was also no way that the E-ranker could do anything against the C-rankers . As such, Hwang Dongseok and co . ’s deaths would be ruled as an unfortunate accident . </p>
<p>“Well, I think that should do it . ”</p>
<p>With a satisfied expression, she finished the recording of the incident . </p>
<p>“The investigation is now over . You are both free to leave . I know today must’ve been hard . The Association thanks you for your cooperation in this matter . ”</p>
<p>“Thank you . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo answered for the pair . </p>
<p>The investigator left as quickly as she had arrived . </p>
<p>“Thank you as well, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho bowed again in a 90-degree angle .  Even after coming out of the Gate, his at-attention-attitude did not change .  The young man probably went through a lot of scary things back there, Jinwoo thought . </p>
<p>“You did well, too . ”</p>
<p>“Eh, I didn’t really do anything . It was all hyungnim . Here, your magic cores . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho respectfully held out a bag with two hands .  Jinwoo took the bag; it was filled to the brim with magic cores .  The highest price for a magic core from a C-rank Gate was 10 million, even the lowest would be worth at least several million .   Jinwoo tried to obtain a rough count of the magic cores he was holding and screamed inside in delight . </p>
<p>‘How much is all of this…?’</p>
<p>He had to hold back the laughter of joy .  Suddenly, drops of water appeared on the bag . </p>
<p>drop . </p>
<p>drop . </p>
<p>Jinwoo raised his head .  The sky that began to darken after noon was now beginning to rain . </p>
<p>‘Good thing I sent her with an umbrella . ’</p>
<p>He smiled at the sudden thought of his little sister . </p>
<p>Deep into the night . </p>
<p>The moment he arrived home, he opened his stat screen . </p>
<p>“Stat!”</p>

<p>He still had the 10 stat points from the emergency quest .  He was itching to use them up . It was an amount that normally required three days of daily quests (albeit missing a point) or two level-ups (but not freely distributable) . </p>
<p>‘First and foremost, agility . Then, sense . ’</p>
<p>He put 7 points into agility and the remaining 3 into sense . </p>

<p>“Okay . ”</p>
<p>His attributes had risen quite a bit .  Agility had almost caught up to his strength, and in no time, his sense had reached 35 points .  Once agility and strength reached the same level, he planned on focusing on constitution . Leaving aside intelligence, which he still did not know the effect of, he wanted to raise his stats evenly . </p>

<p>What made him the happiest registered first: his level, which had jumped by 3 levels, and the newly earned “Bloodlust” skill .  Thanks to the 10 stat points, his attributes looked great as well . Just all this would’ve made a very productive day, but this was not all that he had earned today . </p>
<p>‘On top of the wage of 2 million,’</p>
<p>He opened the bag full of magic cores and started counting . </p>
<p>’11 magic cores from the spider . 38 from Hwang Dongseok’s team . ’</p>
<p>All in all, he had 49 magic cores!</p>
<p>At an average price of 5 million each, he would be walking away with over 200 million . [3]</p>
<p>“200 million in one day…”</p>
<p>Having collected ten, no, nine people’s shares all to himself, Jinwoo had earned an incredible amount .  It was an unthinkable stroke of luck . </p>
<p>‘All that’s left is to sell these . ’</p>
<p>It was not difficult to sell magic cores .  The demand was so high that they would be snatched up the moment they were put up on the market .  The question was where to sell them . He could sell them personally to another individual, to a Guild or through a business .  Looking at the amount he was holding, Jinwoo concluded that instead of a personal sale or using an online market, he would go to an intermediary for brokerage . </p>
<p>‘Wonder if I can just sell these in the shop?’</p>
<p>It would be rather convenient if the shop took the magic cores at face value like the junk items .  Thinking about the shop, Jinwoo put away the bag . He realized the one other progress he had made today . </p>
<p>‘It said I could use the buy function of the shop now, right?’</p>
<p>He quickly opened the shop .  The gold that he had collected in the Instant Dungeon was sitting in his inventory, figuratively collecting dust . </p>
<p>“Buy . ”</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>With that familiar electronic tone, a seemingly endless list of purchasable items appeared before his eyes .  They ranged from cheap potions and miscellaneous accessories to expensive armors and powerful weapons . Every one of them was being sold for gold .  Obviously, the better the item was, more expensive the gold cost . Some of the most powerful items cost as much as 10 billion pieces of gold . </p>
<p>“Whoa… 10 billion…”</p>
<p>His current gold was at 112 thousand .  It was far too low to purchase anything that appeared to be useful, but there was no need to rush .  He had plenty of time . </p>
<p>‘So as long as I gather the gold, I can buy all of this, right?’</p>
<p>He hummed as he continued to browse through the list of items .  He had obtained one more reason to enter an Instant Dungeon . </p>
<p>Jinwoo was already anticipating the reward from tomorrow’s Random Box . </p>
