<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 28</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s heart began to race .  It was because the size of the box was familiar to him .  He quickly unwrapped the box and opened it,</p>
<p>‘It is!’</p>
<p>His eyes opened wide .  There was a golden key inside of the box .  An Instant Dungeon key that he had been wanting for a long time .  The information box popped up on the key . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Demon Castle Key</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: S-rank</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Key</strong>.   </p>
<p>Key to enter an Instant Dungeon .  </p>
<p>Usable in Daesung Tower . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“S-rank?”</p>
<p>His voice was raised .  Of course, there was no guarantee that the rarity of the key indicated the difficulty of the Dungeon, but it would not be an unusual conclusion to have .  After all, the Instant Dungeon he had entered with the E-rank key was as easy as an E-rank Gate’s Dungeon . </p>
<p>What if this key’s Dungeon was S-rank? It would be difficult to clear it even with a team composed of only S-rank Hunters .  The probability of success would be 50% . </p>
<p>Above the B-rank, the difficulty of a Gate increases at a geometric rate .  In the past 10 years since the Gates first started appearing, only a handful of S-rank Gates had opened across the world . </p>
<p>‘And Jejudo[1] was one them…’</p>
<p>After South Korea’s Hunters failed to clear the Dungeon on the island, the S-rank Gate underwent a Dungeon Break, and the island became uninhabitable and was now abandoned by the country . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked at the key in his hand . </p>
<p>‘This is something that I wanted?’</p>
<p>There was one potential silver lining .  Compared to the first key, which “moved” him into the Dungeon, this key stated that he could “enter” the Dungeon[2] .  Jinwoo concluded that the difference in the wording meant that he could move in and out of the Dungeon . Even if the key disappeared like last time, he still had the return stone in his inventory .  He would not be imprisoned by an invisible wall again . </p>
<p>‘Well, I shouldn’t throw away a rare opportunity like this . ’</p>
<p>He would confirm the Instant Dungeon with his own eyes . </p>
<p> .  . </p>
<p>-2 . The Demon Castle-</p>
<p>Jinwoo stood in front of the Daesung Tower .  With exactly hundred floors, the building reached high towards the sky .  Fitting of a skyscraper, even looking up at it from the ground gave a sense of vertigo . </p>
<p>It was currently night, and there was practically no one in the area .  The absence of humans created a gloomy atmosphere . </p>
<p>‘But just in case…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around and lowered the hood over his head tightly .  If someone saw a man disappear into thin air without a Gate in sight, it would surely cause a disturbance .  In the case that he gets caught on the surveillance cameras here and there, a little anonymity would be useful . </p>
<p>As matter of fact, there was someone who was watching Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘What’s he up to?’</p>
<p>The security guard that was posted in the lobby of the building looked at the shady, hooded man who was loitering in front of the building .  The guard rose from his seat and walked over to take a closer look, then was caught off guard in shock . </p>
<p>“W-what?!”</p>
<p>The hooded man that was walking towards the building suddenly disappeared without a trace .  No matter how long the guard stared at the spot, not even an insect could be found . </p>
<p>“Er… Must’ve been seeing things…”</p>
<p>The man turned to go back inside but then saw something in the corner of his eyes .  He screamed and fell to the ground . </p>
<p>“Ah! What the hell?!”</p>
<p>The hand that was floating in the air disappeared again . </p>
<p>Jinwoo retracted the hand that he was holding out . </p>
<p>‘It’s connected to the outside . ’</p>
<p>Unlike last time, there was no invisible wall blocking his exit .  The key also did not disappear but remained in his pockets . Jinwoo confirmed that he would be able to exit and come back whenever . </p>
<p>‘Alright, the path to retreat is secured…’</p>
<p>As he did not know if the rarity of the key corresponded to the difficulty, Jinwoo was being a lot more careful than usual .  He took off his hood and turned around . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was a scenery that invited despair . </p>
<p>Moments ago, when he took few steps towards the Daesung Tower, the world before his eyes changed in an instant . </p>
<p>Could this even be called a Dungeon?</p>
<p>In front of him was an entirely new world . </p>
<p>In place of the Daesung Tower stood a massive tower . </p>
<p>‘Can’t tell if it’s a castle or a tower . ’</p>
<p>The tower that stretched towards the sky was surrounded by a crimson flame .  Instead of being on fire, it was more like the tower was holding the fire back . </p>
<p>“A tower on fire…”</p>
<p>This felt like a more fitting description of the place than a Demon Castle . </p>
<p>Jinwoo took steps toward the tower . </p>
<p>flare!</p>
<p>As he got closer, the sound of the fire roaring became louder . </p>
<p>‘Could I even get inside?’</p>
<p>Even if he could, there was another problem .  The last Instant Dungeon used the subway station as the template for its levels .  If this one used Daesung Tower as its, Jinwoo would have to clear a hundred different levels of monsters .  He could not imagine just how long that would take . </p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>He stopped, feeling a powerful presence near the tower’s gate .  Taking a closer look, he saw a black beast, the size of a bull, rolled up on the ground sleeping .  Jinwoo took out the Casaka’s Poisoned Fang . </p>
<p>ring~</p>

<p>Although its attack power wasn’t that high, its special effects had already proved themselves in battle . </p>
<p>‘It’d be nice if I could just kill after paralyzing it . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo slowly approached the beast, quieting his footsteps as best as he could .  But he could not hide from the monster’s sense of smell . The beast soon started to rise, sniffing the air . </p>
<p>‘Shit . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo clicked his tongue .  The beast’s form, standing up fully, raised three separate heads towards Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Gatekeeper of Hell, Cerberus’ </p>
<p>A vicious looking hound with three heads .  Its heads were adorned by its name in red letters .  This meant the monster’s level was high . </p>
<p>‘If it’s red, does it mean it’s the same as the centipedes from the penalty zone?’</p>
<p>He recalled running for his life from the centipedes .  After all, he was just level 1 back then . </p>
<p>‘I’m different now . ’</p>
<p>In a short period, Jinwoo had experienced an explosive growth .  The monster before him was definitely strong, but it did not give off a feeling of overwhelming pressure .  This was ascertained with Jinwoo’s sense stat . </p>
<p>He had not raised the attribute thoughtlessly .  Valuable points were invested into it so that it could help him determine whether to fight or run from an enemy . </p>
<p>Grrrrrl!</p>
<p>The Cerberus registered an enemy and bared its teeth .  The beast’s tail caught Jinwoo’s eyes momentarily . The long, whip-like tail decorated its tip with powerful flames . </p>
<p>‘Fangs and tail . The thing’s attack pattern will have at minimum two moves . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo gulped .  The Cerberus slowly closed the gap between the two, then stopped right before the Hunter and stared . </p>
<p>‘Is it looking for an openi-’</p>
<p>The Cerberus suddenly leaped towards him . </p>
<p>Woof!</p>
<p>Jinwoo was caught off guard . </p>
<p>‘It’s fast!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly slid underneath the Cerberus’ body and dodged its bite .  Landing on the ground, Cerberus immediately turned around and bared its teeth across all three heads . </p>
<p>Bark! Bark Bark!</p>
<p>The fangs between its jaws shone in the light . </p>

<p>Jinwoo felt his body becoming lighter . </p>
<p>‘I can feel it!’</p>
<p>The Cerberus charged at Jinwoo .  Jinwoo rapidly took backward steps, trying to distance himself from the Cerberus’ advances, and repeatedly blocked its bites with his dagger . </p>
<p>slash, slash, slaaash, slash!</p>
<p>clang! clang clang! clang!</p>
<p>The sound of the metal clashing against the fangs rang loudly .  Although he was swinging the dagger with an incredible speed, it was all he could do to block the Cerberus’ attacks . </p>
<p>‘I’m being pushed back even with the title buff!’</p>
<p>The Cerberus’ agility had surpassed his expectations .  Jinwoo tried to turn the tide of the battle with a skill . </p>

<p>Jinwoo was shocked . </p>
<p>‘It didn’t work?’</p>
<p>The Cerberus’ whipped its tail at Jinwoo . </p>
<p>snap!</p>
<p>Jinwoo reflexively lowered his head to dodge, but this stopped his legs temporarily .  The Cerberus did not miss the opportunity; one of its heads bit down on Jinwoo’s left shoulder . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaak!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo stabbed its forehead with all his strength . </p>
<p>stab!</p>

<p>whimper!</p>
<p>The Cerberus yelped and backed away .  Thankfully, Jinwoo managed to drive it off before the other heads could also bite down, but the damage was done to his left shoulder .  His left arm hung limp at his sides, the joints mangled . The beast’s jaws had a terrifying bite . </p>
<p>Jinwoo furrowed his brows .  Compared to the small damage he had inflicted on the Cerberus, his own injury was far greater . </p>
<p>‘If only paralysis or bleeding had stuck…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo glared at Cerberus with disappointment . </p>
<p>Suddenly, the beast’s eyes started turning red . </p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>grrrrrl</p>
<p>A frightening pressure washed over Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>Jinwoo cried out in frustration,</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>A magic beast, no, a monster using a skill?!</p>
<p>The Cerberus kicked the ground and charged . </p>
<p>‘Shit!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo could not react in time; his swinging dagger bounced uselessly off the beast’s head .  All three heads bit down on Jinwoo . </p>
<p>crack!</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo clenched his teeth .  The beast had simultaneously clamped down on Jinwoo’s neck, sides and thigh .  It continued its momentum and slammed Jinwoo into the castle’s gates . </p>
<p>slam!</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s health plummeted to the ground . </p>
<p>“Cough!”</p>

<p>Thanks to the Unyielding Spirit and his physical damage reduction, Jinwoo managed to avoid an instant death . </p>

<p>[1]: “Jejudo” (제주도): An island province of South Korea .  Considered the “Hawaii” of South Korea, it is a popular destination for tourists (both domestic and foreign) and honeymoons . </p>
<p>[2]: Sorry, in my attempt to be concise in the translation of the first key, I didn’t really emphasize the difference between “moved into” and “enter” . </p>
