<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 31</p>
<p>“Yes, all of the prisoners are C-rank, but the HSD Hunter is a B-rank, so there’s nothing to worry about . ”</p>
<p>Kim Sangshik relented and nodded .  It was a basic theory that you needed at least 10 C-rank Hunters to defeat a single B-ranker .  If such a B-ranker was offering to not only watch the prisoners but also help with the Raid, there was nothing to complain about . </p>
<p>‘A single B-ranker and three C-rankers…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the HSD Hunter and the prisoners with confusion . </p>
<p>‘Something’s weird . ’</p>
<p>There was a strange killing intent spilling forth from one of them .  Was this an effect of the sense stat, or was he just imagining things out of worry? Whatever it was, Jinwoo could not help but feel uneasy . </p>
<p>He whispered to Juhee,</p>
<p>“Juhee-ssi, please don’t go on this Raid . ”</p>
<p>She looked around then responded,</p>
<p>“What about you?”</p>
<p>He answered her question with a question,</p>
<p>“If I go?”</p>
<p>“Then I’m also going . ”</p>
<p>Her face was determined to follow him . </p>
<p>‘I understand you’re worried about me, but…’</p>
<p>Having experienced her stubbornness in the past, Jinwoo relented . </p>
<p>‘I suppose everything should be alright if I’m there . ’</p>
<p>After all, he had single handedly defeated Hwang Dongseok’s party, which included 5 C-rankers . </p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded,</p>
<p>“Alright . Alright . ”</p>
<p>The HSD Hunter finished with the documents then appeared before all the Hunters . </p>
<p>“I’m Kang Taeshik of the Hunter Surveillance Department . I’m sure you’ve already heard the situation . I’ll be keeping a close eye on them, so don’t worry about those bastards . ”</p>
<p>He gestured towards the prisoners, and they came to him and held out their cuffed hands .  One by one, Kang Taeshik uncuffed them . </p>
<p>“Aw man, that was really uncomfortable . ”</p>
<p>“You can’t drag us around like this . We’re not slaves, ya know?”</p>
<p>The freed prisoners rubbed their wrists and complained .  Ignoring them, Kang Taeshik turned toward the Hunters . </p>
<p>“Who’ll be leading the Raid today?”</p>
<p>Having taken the responsibility normally, Song Chiyeol half-heartedly raised his hand . </p>
<p>Kang Taeshik nodded,</p>
<p>“Understood”</p>
<p>With Song Chiyeol in front, the Hunters started entering the Gate . </p>
<p>“Let’s go . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo and Juhee also stood before the Gate .  Remember her last trip into a Dungeon, Juhee lightly held on to Jinwoo’s sleeves as they entered . </p>
<p> .  . </p>
<p>The Dungeon this time was filled with goblins .  Faced against the weakest humanoid type magic beasts, the Raid was a lot easier than expected . </p>
<p>screech!</p>
<p>scree-!</p>
<p>Even before he had powered up, Jinwoo could take on these bizarre looking things .  He carefully defeated of them one by one . His combat prowess surprised Juhee and Song Chiyeol, who had not remembered him like this . </p>
<p>“Whoa~”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was using the bare minimum power required, as to not get noticed, but the difference between his old self was still noticeable . </p>
<p>Juhee approached him and asked,</p>
<p>“Have-have you been learning somewhere?”</p>
<p>“That’s er… I’ve been running every day . ”</p>
<p>“Running?”</p>
<p>Juhee was confused, but it wasn’t exactly a lie . </p>
<p>‘But… I’m not getting any experience points…’</p>
<p>screech!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The enemy’s level was too low . You’ve gained no experience points . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>screech!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The enemy’s level was too low . You’ve gained no experience points . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo was disappointed .  All he kept getting was the message that the goblins’ levels were too low . </p>
<p>‘At this rate…’</p>
<p>Even worse, the magic cores from the goblins were the lowest tier possible .  Jinwoo looked around . Excited at the freedom of movement after a long time, the prisoners were going all out on the goblins . </p>
<p>screech!</p>
<p>screeee!</p>
<p>It was hard to tell who was the human and who was the beast . </p>
<p>‘Looks like I don’t have to do that much . ’</p>
<p>Still, he wasn’t getting experience or good income .  This concerned Jinwoo,</p>
<p>‘If it’s going to be like this all the time, should I just leave the Association?’</p>
<p>The Raids under the Association were mostly D-rank or E-rank Gates, and if he was not getting any experience points in those low-level Dungeons, there was no point to staying with the Association . </p>
<p>‘And at this point, I can easily take care of mother’s hospital bills…’</p>
<p>He could leave the Association whenever he wanted .  This was why having money was good . It allowed Jinwoo more freedom in the paths that he could take . </p>
<p>While he was lost in thought, the party had ventured deep into the Dungeon . </p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>They came across three different paths .  Kang Taeshik suggested to Song Chiyeol,</p>
<p>“The Dungeon’s difficulty is rather low . Shall we split up here?”</p>
<p>“Sounds good . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol agreed .  Jinwoo closed his eyes and focused his senses . </p>
<p>‘Now which path leads to the boss?’</p>
<p>He had hoped at least the boss would give him some small amount of experience .  Soon, the energy of the various lifeform in the Dungeon entered his senses . Opening his eyes, Jinwoo told Song Chiyeol,</p>
<p>“Ahjussi, let’s go to the left path . ”</p>
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo, Juhee and Song Chiyeol chose the left path .  Kang Taeshik and the prisoners chose the right path . The remaining two went down the middle path . </p>
<p>Jinwoo’s heartbeat increased slightly . </p>
<p>‘The boss is at the end of this path . ’</p>
<p>It couldn’t be called strong, but it definitely gave off a tougher presence than the goblins .  Jinwoo wanted to get to the boss quickly . But just after taking few steps into the left path, a group of goblins appeared and blocked their way . </p>
<p>“Kikik . ”</p>
<p>“Kiriririk . ”</p>
<p>“Kiiik . ”</p>
<p>There was about ten of them .  Holding wooden clubs, wooden swords and wooden staves, the goblins gave absolutely no sense of danger to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Aren’t they tired of this?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo scrunched his face in annoyance .  These worthless things that ran at him with no experience points or money were just a thorn at his sides . </p>
<p>“There are ten of them…”</p>
<p>“What should we do? Should we group with the others and come back?”</p>
<p>However, the other two with him were taking it much more seriously . </p>
<p>“Well, since they’re just goblins, we should just give it a go . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Okay . ”</p>
<p>A fireball appeared in Song Chiyeol’s hand and Juhee began preparing her healing magic .  Jinwoo scratched the back of his head . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it, I’ve never been this relaxed in a Dungeon before…’</p>
<p>Was it because he had become incomparably stronger? Applied to a familiar situation from his old life, Jinwoo finally began to feel the changes that he was undergoing . </p>
<p>Song Chiyeol interrupted his thoughts,</p>
<p>“Sung-ssi, are you ready?”</p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo matched the pace of his teammates and slowly stepped up towards the goblins .  Suddenly, a scream rang forth from somewhere . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaak!”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t goblin .  It was a human scream .  Jinwoo and co . looked at each other .  Just as they thought the screams had died out, another one rang forth . </p>
<p>“Ahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol’s face hardened,</p>
<p>“Let’s go check it out . ”</p>
<p>The three Hunters quickly ran towards the direction of the scream .  Jinwoo could’ve easily went ahead of the two but decided to match their speed for their safety .  After running for some time, they came across the source . </p>
<p>Juhee discovered someone and shouted,</p>
<p>“Over there! Someone is…”</p>
<p>The HSD Hunter Kang Taeshik was kneeling on the ground, covered in blood .  He shouted at the approaching party,</p>
<p>“B-be careful! Those bastards are still around somewhere!”</p>
<p>Appearing to have shouted with the last bit of his strength, Kang Taeshik collapsed face-down onto the ground .  Unable to ignore him, Juhee quickly ran toward his body . </p>
<p>“I’ll heal him!”</p>
<p>Even after everything she had gone through, Juhee still held pride as a B-rank Healer .  Even if there were enemies around, her healing would be quick . She concluded that it would be best to heal Kang Taeshik before they could attack . </p>
<p>“Please just wait . ”</p>
<p>She held out her hands in front of Kang Taeshik, and a light gathered in her hands . </p>
<p>It was in that moment, Kang Taeshik shot up from the ground and stretched a hand filled with magic power toward Juhee’s throat . </p>
<p>woosh!</p>
<p>Before his hand could reach Juhee’s throat, someone grabbed his wrist in the nick of time . </p>
<p>grab!</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>Taking few steps backwards in surprise, Juhee fell onto the ground . </p>
<p>Kang Taeshik was surprised . </p>
<p>‘Someone stopped my attack at this distance?’</p>
<p>It was easy for a higher-ranking Hunter to dispose of a lower-ranking one .  That’s why his first target was the female Hunter, who was a B-ranker like him .  Fortunately for him, she was a noncombat-class Hunter, so he had expected to take care of her easily through a surprise attack . </p>
<p>But his attack… was stopped . </p>
<p>The efforts he put toward acting disappeared in a puff of smoke . </p>
<p>Kang Taeshik’s eyes followed the hand holding his wrist to Jinwoo’s face .  Jinwoo’s eyes were filled with murderous intent . Kang Taeshik frowned,</p>
<p>“Just a shitty Association-affiliated Hunter?!”</p>
<p>woosh!</p>
<p>Kang Taeshik’s other fist flew towards Jinwoo’s face, but the man easily turned his head and dodged the attack . </p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Kang Taeshik threw aside Jinwoo’s grip with strength . </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was also surprised .  It was a strength worthy of a high-ranking Hunter . </p>
<p>Having freed himself from Jinwoo’s hands, Kang Taeshik rained his fists upon him mercilessly .  Not losing to his speed, Jinwoo dodged and counterattacked . </p>
<p>Hit! Strike! Woosh! Bam! Pow!</p>
<p>The two men ceaselessly traded and evaded each other’s blows .  Neither of them backed off . </p>
<p>While they were fighting, Song Chiyeol grabbed Juhee and pulled her away from the danger . </p>
<p>“A-ahjussi…”</p>
<p>Juhee could not speak, stunned .  Song Chiyeol was even more surprised than her . </p>
<p>‘How is this possible…?’</p>
<p>Their offense and defense were happening at an unbelievable speed .  It was too fast even to track with his own eyes . The high-ranking Hunter’s movements made sense, but Sung Jinwoo was not the man he had remembered .  The young man was keeping up with the B-ranker . </p>
<p>‘His speed is too fast even for this C-ranker’s eyes!’</p>
<p>He was correct on his feelings earlier .  The Jinwoo that was fighting before him was not the same weak E-ranker from before . </p>
<p>Having traded dozens of exchanges in a blink of an eye, the two fighters backed away from each other to catch their breath . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked at Kang Taeshik with narrowed eyes,</p>
<p>“The blood on your clothes… It’s not yours, is it?”</p>
<p>Kang Taeshik rubbed his wrists replied,</p>
<p>“That’s right . It’s those fuckers’ blood . Putting that aside, to think that I’d meet a Hunter like you here . ”</p>
<p>He was truly awed .  He had no idea that there was an Association-affiliated Hunter that was a high-ranker . </p>
<p>‘This is not good . ’</p>
<p>He had thought that today was the best opportunity to act, but Jinwoo’s appearance had thrown a wrench in his plans . </p>
<p>Kang Taeshik asked out of curiosity,</p>
<p>“Who are you? What’s your ranking?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo summoned Casaka’s Poisoned Fang in his hand and answered . </p>
<p>“Sung Jinwoo . E-rank . ”</p>
