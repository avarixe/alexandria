<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 77</p>
<p>The entire Building B became silent . </p>
<p>‘Did he just say “measurement impossible” . ?’</p>
<p>‘Does that mean that man is an S-ranker?’</p>
<p>‘I’ve only heard of it in stories . To think that I would actually see it in person…’</p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>The representatives from the small Guilds gulped as Jinwoo turned to leave .  However, not one of them could approach him . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>If a C-ranker appeared, a fierce competition would’ve taken place among the representatives to try and recruit the Hunter .  Many of them would line up just to get a word or two in . </p>
<p>And if a B-ranker appeared? The representatives would practically fight each other to offer all kinds of deals, benefits and conditions to the Hunter .  To an outside observer, it would look like a war . Every once in a while, B-rankers who wanted to be the head of a snake instead of the tail of a dragon would be won over . </p>
<p>However, A-rankers were a different story .  They were the special existences that could find a home in large Guilds and ignore small and middle Guilds .  Of course, they would obviously be placed in primary raiding group of any large Guilds they enter, and through their jobs, clear high-level Dungeons and earn an unimaginable amount of money .  That was not all . If they wanted, A-rankers could easily make their own Guilds and become the Guildmaster . And so, they had no reasons to give the time of day to small and middle Guilds . </p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>A magic power that cannot be measured means an S-ranker . </p>
<p>S-rank, not A-rank . </p>
<p>It was the difference of a single letter, but it meant that he was among the nine highest-ranking Awakened Beings of South Korea . </p>
<p>‘Well, if you include him, it’s ten now, right?’</p>
<p>‘The tenth S-rank Hunter…’</p>
<p>He was not a target small and middle Guilds could even think of recruiting . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>All they could do is silently gulp repeatedly .  He was truly a treasure just out of their reach . </p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>‘Wait…’</p>
<p>‘Is this not my chance?’</p>
<p>Some of the more cunning scouts thought of a dastardly idea .  What if they reported the information of an S-rank Awakened Being to a large Guild for money? The S-rankers’ contractual fees surmounted to several tens of billions at minimum .  If they could obtain just 1% of that fee as a finder’s fee, they could retire then and there . And if they were lucky, they could even act as that man’s personal manager . Didn’t some S-rank Hunter’s personal manager receive a Porsche as a birthday present?</p>
<p>‘ . Should I try it?’</p>
<p>‘If it’s me, I could do it…’</p>
<p>‘I should just close my eyes and do it . ’</p>
<p>In that short time, many of the scouts became brazen .  A failure would result in a moment’s humiliation, while a success would change their lives .  The scouts glanced at each other and slowly began to make their move . Suddenly, someone pointed at the building’s entrance,</p>
<p>“Huh? Over there…!”</p>
<p>Was it because they were all holding their breath in anxiety? Everyone turned to where the man was pointing .  The eyes of the scouts opened wide . </p>
<p>“Holy shit!”</p>
<p>Every single person recognized the fashionable man entering Building B . </p>
<p>“Choi… Choi Jongin?”</p>
<p>“Why is the Guildmaster of ‘Hunters’ here?”</p>
<p>Choi Jongin ignored their attentions, lightly pressed his clothes, then walked over to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘He can’t have arrived after receiving a word . It’s too soon . ’</p>
<p>‘Was that man already contracted with Hunters Guild?’</p>
<p>‘Did Hunters Guild already know? Man, the number one Guild sure is something else . ’</p>
<p>The scouts nodded in understanding .  It was a good thing that they did not approach Jinwoo .  If they were found out by Choi Jongin in the process, what would’ve happened to them? The situation finally looked like it was about to resolve . </p>
<p>‘The picture looks completed with Choi Jongin here . ’</p>
<p>‘Damn, this is so cool . ’</p>
<p>‘To think that Hunters Guild’s Guildmaster himself would come… Man, the S-rankers sure are in a different class . ’</p>
<p>While disappointed, the scouts watched the meeting between the Guildmaster of South Korea’s number one Guild and the fresh S-rank Awakened Being in anticipation . </p>
<p>Meanwhile . </p>
<p>Jinwoo saw Choi Jongin’s arrival and sighed in relief . </p>
<p>‘Thank god . ’</p>
<p>He was confused on what to do when all the attention was on him .  Thankfully, Choi Jongin had appeared and took that attention away .  Jinwoo silently thanked the man in his heart and walked past him . </p>
<p>Choi Jongin was taken back . </p>
<p>‘Huh? Wait, this isn’t it . ’</p>
<p>The man quickly stopped Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“Excuse me,”</p>
<p>Jinwoo stopped and turned around,</p>
<p>“ . ?”</p>
<p>Looking at Jinwoo, a light appeared in Choi Jongin’s eyes,</p>
<p>‘This man is the tenth…’</p>
<p>He had told the director that he wanted to come along and see what the fuss was about, but truthfully, Choi Jongin was well aware what had happened here . </p>
<p>‘They were so loud going on about “measurement impossible”, how could I not hear?’</p>
<p>Because of that, he had obtained a large windfall .  The man in front of him was an S-ranker . An S-ranker! If Choi Jongin could bring this man to Hunters Guild, his Guild would have three S-rank Hunters .  Forget Korea, they could stand shoulder to shoulder with the best Guilds across the entire world . He could not help but drool at the thought . </p>
<p>‘There’s no need for me to borrow a measuring device . ’</p>
<p>Just meeting Jinwoo’s eyes, Choi Jongin could feel the other’s power .  He was undoubtedly the highest-ranking Hunter . There was no need to wait three days . </p>
<p>Choi Jongin started with a refreshing smile,</p>
<p>“I am the Hunters Guild’s Guildmaster, Choi Jongin . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo already knew as much .  The man’s face was plastered all over the media .  He was curious on why this celebrity was talking to him all the way at the Association, but he did not have the time to ask .  Jinwoo glanced at the clock on the wall,</p>
<p>‘It’s 5:50 right now . ’</p>
<p>Taking the travel time into account, he barely had any time .  When Jinwoo put on an impatient expression, Choi Jongin continued, a little flustered,</p>
<p>“Ah, well… I heard that you just received your ranking . ”</p>
<p>“Yep . ”</p>
<p>“Do you perhaps have a Guild in mind to join?”</p>
<p>“Nope . ”</p>
<p>With that reply, a bright smile appeared on Choi Jongin’s face . </p>
<p>‘Yes, this is good . ’</p>
<p>He already imagined their future together .  “One of the top three Guilds of the world, Hunters Guild . ”  Oh how sweet that sounded in his mind .  Starting today, it was no longer a pipe dream . </p>
<p>‘You’re mine . ’</p>
<p>Choi Jongin calmed his heart and spoke the words that he believed would go down in history,</p>
<p>“I wish to have a discussion with you about that . Could you please spare the time?”</p>
<p>“Can’t, sorry . ”</p>
<p>And with that, Jinwoo left the building . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Everything happened so quickly .  Choi Jongin was so shocked that he couldn’t even stop Jinwoo .  The Association employees and the scouts realized what happened and fell into chaos . </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Did Guildmaster Choi Jongin just get rejected?”</p>
<p>“He just got ignored just like that!”</p>
<p>The interior of the building became loud with chatter .  Choi Jongin did his best to keep his composure and turned to his side,</p>
<p>“Director Park . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>The director replied with an awkward expression . </p>
<p>“Did I just mess up my introduction?”</p>
<p>“Er… That’s… I’m not sure . ”</p>
<p>Of course, the director had heard every word from start to finish .  However, this was not a time to reply so directly . When the director closed his mouth, the dumbfounded Choi Jongin scratched the side of his face . </p>
<p>‘Did I come on too strong…?’</p>
<p>Well, there was no need to be disappointed .  He definitely was ahead of the other Guilds on this . </p>
<p>‘The only one who knows about the new S-ranker is me . ’</p>
<p>The remeasurement would be three days from now .  He had time until the official announcement . </p>
<p>‘I have to plan a meeting with him somehow until then…’</p>
<p>Was there a good method? While in contemplation, Choi Jongin discovered someone running with all of his might toward the Association building . </p>
<p>‘ . Wait, that’s?’</p>
<p>It was a familiar face .  When the man opened the glass doors and entered the building, Choi Jongin greeted him with shock,</p>
<p>“Guildmaster Baek, why are you…?”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho also saw Choi Jongin and opened his eyes wide in surprise,</p>
<p>“Guildmaster Choi?”</p>
<p>Choi Jongin quickly read Baek Yoonho’s expression . </p>
<p>‘That’s the face of a man who got caught…’</p>
<p>It couldn’t have been that the man had come here after receiving word .  The timing didn’t fit . </p>
<p>‘Baekho’s offices are too far from the Hunter Association…’</p>
<p>That means… Baek Yoonho knew from the start what would happen here . </p>
<p>‘Was he aware of that man’s existence?’</p>
<p>No, if that was the case, Baek Yoonho would not have simply let him undertake a retest like this . </p>
<p>‘If I was aware of such an existence, I would’ve made a contract before letting him take a retest . ’</p>
<p>In that moment, the scattered pieces of the puzzle began to assemble in Choi Jongin’s head . </p>
<p>‘ . Could it be?’</p>
<p>Baekho Guild .  The incident during the new recruit training .  Red Gate . The unknown helper . </p>
<p> . And this new S-rank Awakened Being . </p>
<p>“Looks like Baekho received help from someone that they don’t want to reveal . ”</p>
<p>“A new recruit that didn’t even receive a rank yet? Or a criminal that couldn’t reveal their identity?”</p>
<p>Everything fell into place</p>
<p> . Found him . </p>
<p>‘It was that man . ’</p>
<p>As a sign of just how hard he ran here, Baek Yoonho was panting .  Choi Jongin realized it wasn’t that Baek Yoonho had left the man alone; Baek Yoonho couldn’t prevent the man from taking the retest .  Choi Jongin turned to Baek Yoonho with a smile,</p>
<p>‘You didn’t get him . ’</p>
<p>I’m different than you . </p>
<p>‘Thank you for the opportunity . ’</p>
<p>Without saying anything to the man, Choi Jongin walked past Baek Yoonho . </p>
<p>Baek Yoonho looked around .  He did not see Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Was I too late?’</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho started at Choi Jongin disappearing in the distance and sighed deeply . </p>
<p>“Sigh-”</p>
<p>Of all the days the Hunters Guild’s master could be here .  Baek Yoonho scratched the back of his head and uttered,</p>
<p>“Things just got complicated . ”</p>
<p>Seoul’s Ilshin Hospital’s patient visiting hours ran until 8 p . m .  </p>
<p>“You’re patient Park Gyunghae’s guardian?”</p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>“Visitation should be fine . You’re aware of the visiting hours?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m aware . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo headed to the hospital room where his mother was .  Because he had hurried, he managed to arrive in time . </p>
<p>After opening the door and entering, Jinwoo saw his mother .  The woman was lying on the bed as if sleeping . Her son quietly sat down next to her . </p>
<p>‘Just looking at her like this, it feels like she could wake up any minute…’</p>
<p>The sleep which you would not wake up from .  It was an illness that appeared after the Gates started appearing . </p>
<p>‘They say there’s at least ten other patients with the same condition here . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo gently held his mother’s hand . </p>
<p>“Mom…”</p>
<p>Fortunately, life support devices empowered by magic cores protected her body from wasting away, even after years of unconsciousness .  However, magic cores were expensive . Just the monthly cost of the magic cores used to run the machine was in excess of five million won .  Without the support provided by the Association, it was not an amount that a man in his 20s could pay . Thanks to working as a Hunter under the Association, Jinwoo was able to hold his mother’s hand like this . </p>
<p>But things were different now . </p>
<p>Instead of being just satisfied with the fact that his mother was alive, Jinwoo obtained the means to cure her . </p>
<p>The Holy Water of Life . </p>
<p>The cure gifted by the System . </p>
<p>Whether or not it would work was for the future .  Right now, the priority was to make it . </p>
<p>“I’ll save you . ”</p>
<p>The mother that held the family together with her weak body after their father had disappeared .  They would soon be able to see their mother whole again . </p>
<p>‘Please wait until that time . ’</p>
<p>How long did he stay by his mother’s side? Some time later, Jinwoo finally got up .  After a long visitation, Jinwoo silently left the patient’s room and closed the door .  When he turned around, he ran into a familiar face . </p>
<p>“As I thought… were you the man who took care of the magic beasts in the Double Dungeon that day?”</p>
<p>A deep voice .  Sharp eyes . </p>
<p>It was the Hunter Surveillance Department (HSD) Chief Woo Jincheol . </p>
<p>Jinwoo did not reply .  He neither had the reason nor the desire to do so .  Instead, he asked a question,</p>
<p>“How did you know I was here?”</p>
<p>“I’ve theorized the places where Hunter-nim might go . When I contacted the hospital, they told me you were here . ”</p>
<p>The ones who provided for his mother’s hospital bills were the Association . </p>
<p>‘Well, not anymore . ’</p>
<p>Perhaps the first place they would’ve looked for him was here .  It was a speed fitting of the HSD . Jinwoo smiled widely and spoke,</p>
<p>“Are you here to ask me about that day again?”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol shook his head,</p>
<p>“No, sir . ”</p>
<p>“Then why?”</p>
<p>“There is someone who would like to meet with Hunter-nim . Could you please accompany me?”</p>
<p>Hunter Association’s Hunter Surveillance Department . </p>
<p>The HSD’s primary function was to monitor and arrest any wrong-doing Hunters .  To the Hunters, they weren’t exactly a friendly existence . Jinwoo was the same,</p>
<p>“Is that an order?”</p>
<p>“No, sir . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol removed his sunglasses and bowed his upper body in a near 90-degree angle,</p>
<p>“It is a request . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>To think that the fierce-looking Woo Jincheol would be this respectful to him .  After thinking for a moment, Jinwoo decided he would at least find out who it was,</p>
<p>“Who’s the person that wants to meet with me?”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol raised his head,</p>
<p>“The Hunter Association’s President Go Gunhee-nim . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol gestured to a corner at the end of the hall . </p>
<p>“The association president is here . ”</p>
