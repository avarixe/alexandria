<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 47</p>
<p>Was it because of the restrictions?</p>
<p>The drop rate was good .  He had only taken down three knights, but two of them dropped an item .  It was a drop rate of 66 . 6% . He had not seen a rate like this anywhere else before .  On top of that, most of the items dropped in Instant Dungeons were trash that were sold to the shop .  This was not the case here . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve found a “High-level Knight’s Breastplate” [1]</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to acquire it?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Of course I would . ’</p>
<p>The breastplate of the first knight Jinwoo took out slowly disappeared then reappeared in front of his feet . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>The equipment’s information popped up . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>High-level Knight’s Breastplate</strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>7% physical damage reduction! Combined with his natural buff, he could increase his damage reduction to a total of 27% . </p>
<p>‘If I reach a 100%, do I just become immune to physical damage?’</p>
<p>He dismissed the thought after realizing that a B-rank equipment only gave 7% .  If the pattern stuck, an A-rank equipment would probably not give 30% or 40% reduction, so reaching 100% would be impossible . </p>
<p>‘Still, every little bit counts . ’</p>
<p>Gathering the boosts bit by bit would have a great impact down the line .  He remembered the effectiveness of good equipment the first time he saw Yoo Jinho . </p>
<p>‘So I just do this, right?’</p>
<p>He held up the breastplate .  As expected, the System asked him with a message,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to equip the “High-level Knight’s Breastplate”?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Just looking at the armor, it was not something he wanted to be seen walking around in .  If it wasn’t for his experiences with “Gatekeeper’s Necklace”, he would’ve been a lot more hesitant . </p>
<p>‘Yes . ’</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The “High-level Knight’s Breastplate” has been equipped . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The breastplate was invisible to the eye .  Jinwoo opened up his status screen to confirm the benefits . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Physical Damage Reduction: 27%</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘The reduction increased . ’</p>
<p>He felt his chest; he did not feel anything there .  He twisted and stretched his body but did not feel the armor hinder him .  It was almost as if it wasn’t there . It was the same as the time he equipped the Gatekeeper’s Necklace . </p>
<p>‘Good . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his gaze to the other knight, crumpled up in a corner .  Its crushed form sparked with the light of a drop . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve found a “Leather Pouch”</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to acquire it?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Although it was his handiwork, he felt a little bad at its mangled body .  It seemed that he could not control his strength when using his bare hands in a fight . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>With a solemn expression, he stretched a hand to the light,</p>
<p>‘Acquire . ’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve opened the leather pouch . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>There was 30,000 gold inside . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve acquired 30,000 gold . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>Without even appearing in his hands, the leather pouch was just opened .  It appeared that this was a little different than the other items . He opened his inventory and confirmed that he had received the 30,000 gold . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Current Gold: 863,400</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Thirty thousand in one go, eh?’</p>
<p>Was it because knights normally carried that much? He remembered that in video games, humanoid monsters often dropped more items than others .  Well, it made sense that humans carried more things than beasts or bugs . Not that it was certain the System was copying all of that . Still, this was good news .  There were still many things he wanted to buy with gold, and it would be good if gold kept dropping this way . </p>
<p>‘Anything else I could take?’</p>
<p>They say there was no end to man’s greed .  Jinwoo looked around with greedy eyes . The knights’ armors were all crushed by his hands and did not look usable… His gaze fell upon their swords . </p>
<p>‘That looks usable . ’</p>
<p>A clean longsword that looked new .  Since it was not a dagger, he didn’t plan on using it, but he could probably sell in the shop or to other Hunters .  Jinwoo picked up the sword . However, the moment he raised the weapon, it rapidly rusted then turned to dust in his hands . </p>
<p>“Shit…”</p>
<p>It happened in a blink of an eye . </p>
<p>‘It won’t let me obtain anything if it’s not a drop?’</p>
<p>Regrettable, but there was nothing he could do .  He clapped his hands and picked up the torch he had dropped earlier . </p>
<p>Turning around the corner to where the knights had come from, he saw yet another deep, dark tunnel . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>It seemed that there was still a long way to go . </p>
<p>It was funny, but it almost seemed like he had to study the encounters like a test .  After 2 hours of wandering the Dungeon, he had come across 4 types of monsters:</p>
<p>Knights, Mages, Assassins and Archers . </p>
<p>“Is it ‘Stealth’ this time?”</p>
<p>The assassin had disappeared before his eyes .  Without panicking, Jinwoo immediately focused his senses and detected the enemy approaching from his back . </p>
<p>clang!</p>
<p>Jinwoo parried the assassin’s dagger with Casaka’s Poisoned Fang, then quickly counterattacked after it fell off his balance .  His dagger found its way straight into the enemy’s chest . </p>
<p>stab!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated the Assassin . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve leveled up!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>After receiving a fatal blow, the assassin turned into black smoke without so much as a scream .  </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>All that was left in its place was the leather armor it was wearing . </p>
<p>‘I wonder why they’re all humanoid . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo thought this every time he defeated one of them .  Thankfully, he did not get to see their faces when they fought .  The knights had their helmets, the assassins and archers their leather hoods, and the mages covered their heads with the hood of their robes . </p>
<p>Jinwoo turned to continue on his path . </p>
<p>Suddenly, a flash blinded his vision .  A mage that hid its presence had completed casting its light-element spell . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>It was an explosion that pierced the ears!</p>
<p>But Jinwoo had already moved behind the mage . </p>
<p>“ . !”</p>
<p>The mage detected a presence behind it and quickly began to cast a spell, but Jinwoo had already brought down his dagger down upon it .  The mage disappeared with a black smoke . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the robe that lost its owner and put away his dagger . </p>
<p>‘I was hit by an attack like that before, you see . ’</p>
<p>In fact, he was already preparing to move when he felt the collection of mana from a distance .  Jo Gyuhwan’s light-element magic . Jinwoo was not as naive as to be struck by an attack he was hit with before .  This was the meaning of studying the encounters . </p>
<p>‘Not only that . ’</p>
<p>Each of the monsters needed a specific stat to deal with . </p>
<p>Knights with strength, assassins with sense, archers with agility and mages with constitution . </p>
<p>If the appropriate stat was not above a certain level, dealing with the corresponding enemy would’ve been very difficult .  With a low strength, he wouldn’t have been able to damage the armor of the knight; with a low sense, he wouldn’t have been able to detect the assassin . </p>
<p>‘Looks like distributing my stats evenly was helpful for situations like this’</p>
<p>Well, his intelligence was a bit low, but that could be dealt with by managing his mana carefully . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve opened the leather pouch . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo opened his inventory and took out the canteen and drank from it . </p>
<p>“Whew-”</p>
<p>Fatigue was piling up .  </p>
<p>‘How much longer do I have to go?’</p>
<p>No, was there even an end?</p>
<p>Jinwoo dropped the empty canteen and stood with his hands on his hip .  It’s been 3 hours since he had started the quest . Both his body and mind were becoming tired . </p>
<p>‘ . Should I rest for a bit?’</p>
<p>He sat down with his back against the cave wall . </p>
<p>‘Status screen . ’</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Fatigue: 66</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>His fatigue had almost reached a dangerous point .  Above 70, it would have a noticeable debuff on his body and mind .  Even for a moment, he had to rest his eyes and recover his stamina .  Jinwoo rested his head against the wall and quickly began to doze off .  Even in this environment, he was so tired that he would fall asleep in a moment .  Unfortunately…</p>
<p>thwip-!</p>
<p>A sharp sound flew across the air! With his agility stat slowing down the world, Jinwoo was able to grab the arrow that was flying towards him . </p>
<p>grab!</p>
<p>The Hunter’s eyes shot open .  At a distance, the archer was preparing its next shot . </p>
<p>‘Won’t let me even sleep, huh . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo summoned Casaka’s Poisoned Fang as he got up . </p>
<p>crack!</p>
<p>The breastplate caved in at Jinwoo’s punch, and the knight struck the wall .  Its body slid down the wall, sprawled out on the ground and stopped moving . </p>
<p>ring~</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that it was not accompanied by a status recovery, but Jinwoo was still steadily leveling up through the battles .  It was a small consolation amidst the piling up fatigue . The man stared at his slightly scratched knuckles and clicked his tongue . It would be nice if he could just rest for a little bit, but the monsters did not give him any room to breathe .  Thankfully, they did drop a lot of items . </p>

<p>Other than what he had equipped, there were several items that he put away in his inventory as well . </p>
<p>‘Wish they dropped a usable weapon . ’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the daggers dropped by the assassins, while having a similar attack power as Casaka’s Poisoned Fang, did not have any special effects so could not be considered an upgrade . </p>
<p>‘Alright, what’ve you got?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stretched a hand toward the light from the fallen knight . </p>

<p>‘Oooh . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo obtained the gauntlets with a happy expression and equipped them .  Just like the other equipment, the gauntlets did not show their form and did not impede his fingers . </p>
<p>‘Good . ’</p>
<p>After moving his fingers around, Jinwoo raised his head . </p>
<p>Ahead of the tunnel, the torches that lined the wall finally ended .  At their end was a giant door . Jinwoo remembered the entrance of the underground temple from back then .  His party was not prepared and met a tragic fate through the doors . </p>
<p>It would be different this time . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked back on the path that he had walked so far . </p>
<p>‘It’s been six hours since I came in here…’</p>
<p>His level had reached 45, and he had picked up a lot of new equipment . </p>
<p>He was prepared . </p>
<p>He wanted to rest for a bit and recover his stamina, but he knew that it would just summon more monsters that would interrupt his sleep .  He could not afford to increase his fatigue any more through such encounters . </p>

<p>‘I have to win with just this . ’</p>
<p>After performing a final check on his status, Jinwoo grabbed the handles of the door . </p>

<p>As if moved by some unknown mechanism, the doors opened apart easily . </p>

<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “High-level Knight’s Breastplate” (상급 기사의 흉갑): “advanced/high level” 상급 + “knight” 기사 + “breastplate” 흉갑</p>
<p>[2]: All pretty literal and straight forward .  The equipment are divided into 3 tiers, high-level, mid-level and low-level (상급, 중급, 하급) . </p>
