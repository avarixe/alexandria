<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 88</p>
<p>Team Leader Bae was shocked,</p>
<p>“Did… did something happen? Should I go call for reinforcements from the Guild?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing like that . It’s for a personal reason . I just have something I want to talk with the man, so you don’t have to worry . ”</p>
<p>“Oh… Okay . ”</p>
<p>Cha Haein turned towards the Gate .  Suddenly, she felt an emptiness at her side . </p>
<p>‘Ah… my weapon . ’</p>
<p>Patting her hips here and there without looking, she realized she had left her sword at home .  Well, it’s not like she had planned on going into the Dungeon today . Her pretty forehead gently wrinkled . </p>
<p>‘I know Raid Leader Gihoon-ssi is a dependable man, and of course all the team members are capable Hunters but…’</p>
<p>Entering a Dungeon without a weapon was an unthinkable thing .  After a moment of contemplation, Cha Haein turned to Team Leader Bae . </p>
<p>“Is there anything else…?”</p>
<p>“Team Leader, could I borrow a weapon?”</p>
<p>“Ma’am?”</p>
<p>After hesitating, the team leader indicated to a passing miner,</p>
<p>“Hey, Suk-ssi, bring one of the equipment over here . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . ”</p>
<p>What Suk-ssi brought in a flash was the mining team’s… pickaxe . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Cha Haein’s expression hardened,</p>
<p>“Is… is there anything else?”</p>
<p>“When you say anything else…”</p>
<p>“Like a sword, or maybe a spear . ”</p>
<p>“Deputy Guildmaster, if you’re asking for something like that from us…”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Cha Haein lightly sighed,</p>
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>She respectfully declined the pickaxe Team Leader Bae was holding out then headed towards the Gate .  The team leader looked at her with worry then asked,</p>
<p>“Hunter Cha-nim, are you sure you’ll be alright empty-handed?”</p>
<p>flinch . </p>
<p>Cha Haein froze in her spot and thought about it .  She quickly turned around and took the pickaxe from the team leader .  The man chuckled,</p>
<p>“Good thinking . No matter what, going into a Dungeon empty-handed is dangerous . ”</p>
<p>“Thank you…”</p>
<p>As she turned around and left, the team leader did not notice how red her ears had gotten . </p>
<p>Strong look of determination filled the entire party’s faces .  Every one of them accepted their fates and walked with resolve .  Meanwhile, the female Healer came over to Jinwoo and looked through the bag on his back .  Jinwoo turned his head and asked,</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Hold on . ”</p>
<p>What she took out was a woman’s handbag . </p>
<p>“From a long time ago, I felt strangely worried when my bag was away from me, so I take it with me on Raids . ”</p>
<p>She sure liked to answer questions he didn’t ask . </p>
<p>She took out a small notepad and a pen from the bag; the Healer began to write something in the notepad .  Because she was not looking where she was walking, she kept bumping her head into Jinwoo’s shoulders . Soon, she finished and closed her notepad .  She put her handbag back into Jinwoo’s bag but held on to the notepad . Curious on what she would do next, the woman suddenly held the notepad out to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“ . ?”</p>
<p>He took the notepad with a tilted head, and the woman spoke with tears in her eyes,</p>
<p>“I just wrote some things that I wanted to say to my family . When you get to the outside, please make sure it gets to their hands . ”</p>
<p>If he laughed right now, she would be really hurt .  For the umpteenth time in front of this woman, Jinwoo suppressed his laughter and put the notepad into his pockets . </p>
<p>“I’ll hold on to it, but I don’t think I’ll have the chance to deliver it . ”</p>
<p>“It’s okay . ”</p>
<p>The Healer nodded . </p>
<p>‘Of course, all the high orc warriors are keeping an eye on us . It’ll be difficult for him to leave here alive . ’</p>
<p>After all, porter-ssi was only an E-ranker .  </p>
<p>The woman would later realize what Jinwoo had really meant . </p>
<p>Soon, the boss room came into view .  The nervousness of the Hunters reached its peak .  The room was incredibly large . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around the boss room .  It was bigger than the room the giant-type magic beast was in yesterday .  Unlike yesterday however, the room did not feel big .  It was because of the horde of high orcs that took up the entire room .  High orcs twice the number of the group that came to pick up the raiding party waited in the room . </p>
<p>‘About a hundred of them… maybe a little higher?’</p>
<p>Instead of being scattered about the Dungeon’s interior, all the magic beasts were gathered in the boss room .  Looking over the horde of the high orcs, Son Gihoon’s face turned pale . </p>
<p>‘If this many high orcs leave the Gate…’</p>
<p>By the time the highest-ranking Hunters arrived, a small city could be destroyed .  The Tanker’s back became wet with sweat . </p>
<p>‘At the very least, we have to kill the boss . ’</p>
<p>He pressed that determination deep into his heart . </p>
<p>The high orcs in the room parted to make a road . </p>
<p>“Ah shaku . ”</p>
<p>The high orc captain gestured to the raiding party again .  Following the guiding high orcs, the raiding party walked towards an altar at the end of the boss room . </p>
<p>“Over there!”</p>
<p>A Hunter pointed to the top of the altar .  On top, there was a masked high orc sorcerer .  The sorcerer was wearing a necklace and earrings made of bones and was covered from head to toe in various adornments and ornaments . </p>
<p>‘So that’s the boss…’</p>
<p>Son Gihoon’s expression hardened .  He realized that the terrifying magic power that filled the Dungeon was mostly coming from him .  The boss was surrounded by four bodyguards that also gave off a dangerous presence . </p>
<p>‘This is not good . ’</p>
<p>Could they ambush the sorcerer with those bodyguards around? All the members of the raiding party had this thought . </p>
<p>The raiding party stopped before the sorcerer .  A strange nervousness filled the high orcs that watched the procession from a distance in the boss room . </p>
<p>“Hue hue . ”</p>
<p>However, the sorcerer ignored the uneasiness his minions felt and laughed, revealing a hideous mouth . </p>
<p>“Welcome, humans . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters of the raiding party exchanged signals . </p>
<p>‘Once Son hyung gives the signal . ’</p>
<p>‘We’ll all attack at once . ’</p>
<p>‘Just focus on the sorcerer . ’</p>
<p>They were looking for the opportunity to attack . </p>
<p>Suddenly, the air around them became incredibly chilling .  All the Hunters raised their heads as one at the source of the chill .  It was the sorcerer . The high orc boss had removed the mask he was wearing, and with it, the magic power that he had been hiding was unleashed in full . </p>
<p>WOOOSH-</p>
<p>A horrible wave of magic power shot from the sorcerer in all directions, washing over the entire Dungeon .  Like a prey frozen in front of a predator, the Hunters of the raiding party became like statues . </p>
<p>“M-my god…”</p>
<p>“How is this amount of magic power even possible?”</p>
<p>“W-we have to fight with this thing?”</p>
<p>Frustration, Lamentation, Resentment, Regret . </p>
<p>At the different forms of despair the Hunters showed, the sorcerer made an ugly smile with its mouth again . </p>
<p>“Are you afraid of me, humans?”</p>
<p>Biting his lips, Son Gihoon took a step forward with difficulty and asked,</p>
<p>“Why did you bring us all the way here? Those warriors should’ve been more than enough to kill us all . ”</p>
<p>The sorcerer sneered widely .  Just looking at its smile made the Hunters shudder . </p>
<p>“For fun . ”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Son Gihoon was dumbstruck .  That was the reason why they were brought here? For fun?</p>
<p>The sorcerer continued,</p>
<p>“In the time we have remaining, each of you will die one by one to entertain my soldiers!”</p>
<p>UWAAAAAAH-!</p>
<p>The high orc warriors roared in excitement .  At the oppressive pressure they gave off, the Hunters struggled to even breathe .  Some of them were even crying . </p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>The sorcerer hesitated .  The boss looked over the Hunters then stopped at Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“ . There is something interesting mixed among the humans . ”</p>
<p>In an instant, Son Gihoon’s eyes flared . </p>
<p>‘The sorcerer is distracted! Now is the time!’</p>
<p>Veins popped up in the Raid Leader’s throat,</p>
<p>“NOW!”</p>
<p>With a roar, Son Gihoon took his sword and ran forward . </p>
<p>However… there was no sound coming from behind him . </p>
<p>‘What…?’</p>
<p>While running, he quickly looked back .  His teammates did not show any indication that they would be moving .  Their fighting spirits had been crushed by the oppressive display of power; their bodies frozen in terror .  Son Gihoon’s heart sank to his stomach . </p>
<p>‘Ah…’</p>
<p>Still, he had a job to do .  He could not stop here . The Raid Leader looked forward again .  The sorcerer was still laughing, and the bodyguards had not reacted yet .  This was it . His first and only chance . It’s okay if it was luck . It’s okay if it was a fluke .  This sword just needed to reach it…</p>
<p>step, step, step!</p>
<p>Charging with all his might, Son Gihoon brought his sword backwards . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaaah-!”</p>
<p>However, he did not get the chance to swing his sword .  Instead, he bounced against something and was thrown back . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>It was a shield magic . </p>
<p>“cough!”</p>
<p>Blasted back by the barrier, Son Gihoon rolled across the ground . </p>
<p>“So, we have our first volunteer . ”</p>
<p>With the sorcerer’s mocking words, Son Gihoon’s body floated to the air . </p>
<p>woooong-</p>
<p>It was reverse gravity magic . [1]</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>The sorcerer’s lips were moving continuously with incantations .  After raising the Tanker to the height of a two-story building, the sorcerer recited a different spell . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Gravity acceleration . [2]</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>Son Gihoon was slammed onto the ground . </p>
<p>“Cough!”</p>
<p>Before he could even flail about in pain, he was raised in to the air again . </p>
<p>“Reverse gravity . ”</p>
<p>kik kik kik</p>
<p>Along with the sorcerer, the high orcs revealed their tusks and laughed . </p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>“Cough!”</p>
<p>woooooong-</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>“COUGH!”</p>
<p>The sorcerer repeatedly raised and slammed Son Gihoon like a puppet .  The fourth time the man was slammed into the ground, Son Gihoon threw up a torrent of blood .  Watching their leader’s torture, the Hunters’ faces turned more and more pale . But not one of them could gather the courage to step forward . </p>
<p>“G-Gihoon hyung…”</p>
<p>All they could do was just watch while trembling as Son Gihoon was being broken apart . </p>
<p>collapse</p>
<p>The female Healer finally lost the strength to stay standing and fell to her knees . </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the sorcerer raised Son Gihoon for the fifth time . </p>
<p>“You sure are a sturdy one . ”</p>
<p>“groan…”</p>
<p>The man groaned in pain in the air .  However, his hands held his sword tightly, not intending to give up until the bitter end . </p>
<p>woooong-!</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>woooong-!</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>woooong-!</p>
<p>The bitter end came close for the Tanker .  As he was raised into the air again, he could not hold onto the sword anymore .  It fell to the ground . </p>
<p>clang</p>
<p>With it, Son Gihoon’s body fell for the last time…</p>
<p> . Or so everyone had thought . </p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>The sorcerer’s eyes widened .  The Tanker falling to the ground suddenly had disappeared .  The thing should have been smashed to pieces, where did he go? The sorcerer moved his eyes to look for the man’s presence . </p>
<p>‘Over there…?’</p>
<p>In some distance away, Son Gihoon was lying down on the ground .  At the same time, the sorcerer discovered a man next to Son Gihoon .  It was Jinwoo . </p>
<p>After laying the man down gently, Jinwoo asked the Raid Leader while staring at the sorcerer,</p>
<p>“Leader-ssi, I’m going to ask you just one thing . ”</p>
<p>“ . ?”</p>
<p>Up until that point, Son Gihoon had no idea what had happened to him . </p>
<p>“Is it okay if I kill all the magic beasts here?”</p>
<p>“You… what are you… saying?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the sorcerer raised his chin at Jinwoo while furrowing his brows .  One of the bodyguards turned and charged at the E-ranker . Watching it run toward him, Jinwoo’s eyes flashed with a light .  The man held out a hand towards the approaching high orc . </p>
<p>‘Ruler’s Hands . ’</p>
<p>With that, the high orc bodyguard floated to the air as if grabbed by a giant, invisible hand . </p>
<p>“Keu, krah?”</p>
<p>It flailed its legs in the air . </p>
<p>‘What…?’</p>
<p>The sorcerer’s eyes became wide . </p>
<p>Jinwoo moved the tip of his hands to the ground . </p>
<p>SLAM!</p>
<p>The bodyguard was slammed to the ground .  The strength of the fall cracked the floors . </p>
<p>However, Jinwoo did not stop there . </p>
<p>Just like the sorcerer had done to Son Gihoon, the E-rank Hunter raised the bodyguard to the air again . </p>
<p>SLAM!</p>
<p><strong>SLAM!</strong>.  . </p>
<p>SLAM!</p>
<p>The high orc screamed while being bounced between the ceiling and the floor like a basketball, then was silenced when its head was nailed to the ceiling . </p>
<p>CRACK!</p>
<p>scatter</p>
<p>Bits and pieces of the powdered ceiling fell to the ground .  Looking at the swaying body of the high orc stuck to the ceiling, both the high orcs and the Hunters could not hide their shock . </p>
<p>Son Gihoon trembled as he asked,</p>
<p>“You… who are you…?”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask again . ”</p>
<p>This was the hunting grounds of Hunters Guild .  There was only one person here who could act as the representative of Hunters Guild .  Jinwoo asked for the last time,</p>
<p>“The magic beasts in this room… Can I take them all?”</p>
<p>What was this feeling? Son Gihoon no longer cared about the identify of the porter .  He was just angry . Angry at the fact that he was played with like a toy by a magic beast .  Streaks of tears fell down from the Raid Leader’s eyes as he replied,</p>
<p>“Please… Please help us . ”</p>
<p>Done . </p>
<p>As Jinwoo stood up, the high orcs approached him .  At their back was the sorcerer . The high orc boss laughed derisively,</p>
<p>“For a human, you have an interesting trick . ”</p>
<p>The sorcerer gestured, and the high orcs surrounded Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“How far will that trick carry you, I wonder?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s expression turned unbelievably cold . </p>
<p>The man had never liked magic beasts, but this was the first time he had come across one that he wanted to kill this much . </p>
<p>“You . You’ll be the last . ”</p>
<p>If it could feel joy, it could certainly feel fear . </p>
<p>If not, it will learn . </p>
<p>Jinwoo spoke with a low voice,</p>
<p>“Shadows,”</p>
<p>Two daggers appeared in his hands,</p>
<p>“Come forth . ”</p>
<p> .  . </p>
