<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 35</p>
<p>Jinwoo picked up a stone from the ground .  It also disappeared from sight . </p>
<p>‘What about this?’</p>
<p>He went and put his hand on the shoulder of a dead hobgoblin, but it did not become invisible .  Bit by bit, he was beginning to understand the limits of the skill . It seemed that it applied to something that he was wearing and something that he could hold in his hands .  Suddenly,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You are out of mana . ‘Stealth’ will be cancelled . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The ‘Stealth’ skill had been cancelled . </p>
<p>‘It’s only been a few seconds, but my mana is already gone?’</p>
<p>He had been trying to get used to the invisible form, testing out its effects here and there .  Jinwoo opened up the skill listing with a dumbfounded expression . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Skills</strong>. </p>
<p>Passive Skills</p>
<p>-(Unknown) (Lv . Max)</p>
<p>-Unyielding Spirit (Lv . 1)</p>
<p>Active Skills</p>
<p>-Sprint (Lv . 1)</p>
<p>-Bloodlust (Lv . 1)</p>
<p>-Stealth (Lv . 1)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>What he wanted was the ‘Stealth’ information .  The words appeared in the air before him . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<p>  . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stealth (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Active Skill</strong>. </p>
<p>Mana Cost: 200 (+10/Second)</p>
<p>Activate to disappear (sight, sound, smell)</p>
<p>Costs 10 mana per second to maintain . </p>
<p>“Become invisible and hide the traces of your existence . ”</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The activation cost is 200 and it uses up 10 mana per second?</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>No wonder his mana ran out so fast . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>MP: 7 / 548</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong> </strong>. </p>
<p>His remaining 7 mana seemed to laugh at him . </p>
<p>‘It really hit rock bottom . ’</p>
<p>With his current mana, he could maintain ‘Stealth’ for a little under 35 seconds .  However, if he factored in other skills into calculation, it would be far less than that . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it, even Kang Taeshik released the skill after few seconds . ’</p>
<p>It was clear that the B-rank Hunter did not do so out of some dramatic flair .  He probably did not have the magic power to maintain the skill for long . If the high-ranker Kang Taeshik was like that, low-rankers probably couldn’t even activate the skill . </p>
<p>“Looks like mana is the problem . ”</p>
<p>He had invested points in every stat except for intelligence so far, but his mana did not increase .  This told him that to increase his mana, he had to raise the intelligence stat…</p>
<p>‘Do I have to start putting points into intelligence?’</p>
<p>But it felt a little wasteful to invest his valuable points just so he could use a skill for a little longer .  Especially because Jinwoo felt that intelligence was not a stat directly usable in combat . </p>
<p>‘Compared to the others, intelligence really feels lacking . ’</p>
<p>Strength, constitution, agility, sense . </p>
<p>As each of those stats rose, he became noticeably stronger .  But even when he had raised the intelligence stat through level-ups, he did not gain any worthwhile powerup .  Compared to when he was level 1, his intelligence stat had nearly quadrupled, but the only thing it gave him was increased mana .  That was it . To invest valuable points into the stat just for that was…</p>
<p>‘Too wasteful . ’</p>
<p>Using those points in the other four attributes equaled to directly strengthening his flesh and blood .  In the end, Jinwoo decided that he would just increase his mana through level-ups . The stat points would be distributed into the other, more useful stats . </p>
<p>‘Stat points…’</p>
<p>He remembered that he still had 5 points received from the emergency quest .  After thinking about putting them into intelligence, Jinwoo instead put 3 points into strength and 2 points in to constitution . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 75</p>
<p>Constitution: 45</p>
<p>Agility: 82</p>
<p>Intelligence: 39</p>
<p><strong>Sense: 69</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>(Available stat points: 0)</strong>.   </p>
<p>Physical Damage Reduction: 20%</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong> </strong>. </p>
<p>‘Yep . Multiples of five are a good thing . ’</p>
<p>As Jinwoo smiled in satisfaction,</p>
<p>SHAAAAAKE!</p>
<p>The Dungeon’s interiors shook as if the world was ending . </p>
<p>‘Has it already been one hour?’</p>
<p>There was no time to delay anymore .  Jinwoo closed his stat screen . He had purposely waited inside until right before the Gate would close .  Staying here any longer would mean that he would never be able to leave . Jinwoo did a final check before leaving the boss room . </p>
<p>‘Let’s see, I got all the magic cores…’</p>
<p>There was nothing he had forgotten .  After going over every detail, Jinwoo quickly ran through the Dungeon . </p>
<p>SHAAAAAAKE!!!</p>
<p>As if telling him to leave, the Dungeon shook intensely again . </p>
<p>Right on time, the Association’s investigators and employees had arrived .  They watched Jinwoo exit the Gate just as it closed and asked,</p>
<p>“H-Hunter-nim! Are there any other survivors?”</p>
<p>“No . ”</p>
<p>“Oh no!”</p>
<p>The employee’s expressions hardened .  9 people had entered the Dungeon; only 3 had come out alive .  This would be yet another major incident for the Association in the area .  Faced with the prospect of a second incident, the Association employees assigned to this sector grimaced .  They wanted to enter the Dungeon themselves to check for survivors, but the Gate had already closed . This was the reason why Jinwoo had purposely waited until the last minute to exit . </p>
<p>‘Can’t let them know there was another survivor . Was . ’</p>
<p>Now, the only witnesses were the three that had survived .  An employee started talking hesitantly,</p>
<p>“Just now . we’ve received the confession of Gold Mountain Company’s president over the phone . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol stepped forward,</p>
<p>“The president of Gold Mountain Company?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s one of the prisoner’s victim’s father who had contacted HSD Hunter Kang Taeshik for an assassination . ”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>The employee explained that once he had heard that Kang Taeshik had succeeded in killing the prisoner, the president of the company had confessed to everything . </p>
<p>‘Well, it wasn’t Kang Taeshik, but me…’ Jinwoo thought . </p>
<p>The police had gone to the company president, and the Association had come to the Gate . </p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Jinwoo asked,</p>
<p>“So there are no problems, right?”</p>
<p>The employee responded embarrassingly,</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose so . ”</p>
<p>Kang Taeshik’s crimes had a clear evidence, and the three survivors had fought him for their own lives .  As Jinwoo said, there was indeed no problems . Except one . </p>
<p>The employee asked something that was troubling him,</p>
<p>“Who killed the B-rank Hunter Kang Taeshik?”</p>
<p>Having just arrived, the employees had not heard this part of the story yet .  The distance to the Association HQ was far from here, and the employees had hurriedly made efforts to arrive before the Gate closed .  They all looked very tired . </p>
<p>Jinwoo decided to tell the truth, then thought of Yoo Jinho . </p>
<p>‘It’s unfortunate but looks like I won’t be able to help him anymore . ’</p>
<p>If he told the truth, he would have to undergo a retest and have his rank raised .  Once that happened, his part in Yoo Jinho’s plans would be over . After all, what the young man needed was not only a skilled Hunter, but a low ranking one .  Once he received his new rank, Jinwoo would no longer qualify . </p>
<p>‘Hmm… what’s with this feeling?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo imagined Yoo Jinho’s disappointed face .  Instead of feeling sorry, he actually felt like laughing .  Still, it was a shame that he wouldn’t get that building . </p>
<p>‘Well, what could I do…’</p>
<p>Determined, Jinwoo started opening his mouth but was interrupted,</p>
<p>“It was me . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned towards the voice .  Lee Juhee was staring at Song Chiyeol in shock . </p>
<p>“Ahjussi…?”</p>
<p>Before Jinwoo could stop him, the old man stepped forth . </p>
<p>“I was the one who killed Kang Taeshik . ”</p>
<p>The employee looked suspicious,</p>
<p>“Hunter Song Chiyeol-nim was the one?”</p>
<p>That was impossible .  Song Chiyeol was a C-ranker; on top of that, he was missing an arm .  His opponent was a B-ranker, whose existence would be called a high-ranker .  Their strength exceeded imagination . The difference between a B-ranker and a C-ranker was incomparable to the difference between a C-ranker and a D-ranker . </p>
<p>Song Chiyeol laughed and replied,</p>
<p>“You all know who’s standing behind me, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>All eyes fell on Lee Juhee, who lowered her embarrassed face . </p>
<p>Lee Juhee was also a B-rank Hunter .  She may not be a combat-class Hunter, but she was still a high-ranker like Kang Taeshik .  If a B-rank Healer supported a C-rank Hunter, there just might have been a chance that they prevailed .  The employees all nodded understandingly . While they were thinking about the possibilities, Jinwoo went up to Song Chiyeol’s side and quietly asked,</p>
<p>“Why did you lie?”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol replied with a subdued voice,</p>
<p>“I felt like Sung-ssi had a reason to hide your abilities . Should I not have?”</p>
<p>Of course not .  Thanks to the elder, Jinwoo would be able to avoid a thorn in his side for a bit longer .  Jinwoo was impressed by the old man’s ability to take a hint . </p>
<p>“No, no . I’m grateful . ”</p>
<p>“I’m the one who has to be grateful . I’m just glad I was able to help out a little . ”</p>
<p>An Association investigator approached the pair . </p>
<p>“Song Chiyeol-ssi, could you please come with us? We just have to wrap-up the details . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol left with the investigator to the Association, along with the rest of the employees .  Soon, only Jinwoo and Juhee remained . The sun had already set a while ago . Feeling awkward near the changed Jinwoo, Juhee shyly approached him and asked,</p>
<p>“Could we walk together for a bit?”</p>
<p>‘Is this about the dinner promise?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was hungry after moving around for a while and felt that it was a good timing .  He happily agreed,</p>
<p>“Sure . ”</p>
<p>Under the streetlights, the pair walked, side by side, in silence . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Juhee stared at her feet as they walked .  Everytime she looked up, she peaked a glance at Jinwoo .  She wanted to ignore it, but she could not ignore the fact that the man felt a lot stronger than before .  She had found him more comfortable to be near in the past . Now, it was hard to even strike up a conversation with him . </p>
<p>‘Just what happened to him…?’</p>
<p>Not just the fact that he had easily defeated a B-rank Hunter .  The man’s presence felt completely different than before . He had asked for her silence, so she did not want to press the issue . </p>
<p>But his abrupt change bothered her for some reason . </p>
