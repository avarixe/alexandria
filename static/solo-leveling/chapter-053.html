<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 53</p>
<p>Oh, right!</p>
<p>An idea flashed across Jinwoo’s head . </p>
<p>‘I can’t waste another second . ’</p>
<p>He just saw the power of the new skill .  He could turn a slain monster into an undead soldier .  If that was the case, there was a monster nearby that he had to quickly turn into his own! Jinwoo went up on the pile of armors that made up the golem .  He was able to see the entire room from the top . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>His eyes scanned across the room and found his target . </p>
<p>Found him!</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly ran towards the direction . </p>
<p>step, step, step, step!</p>
<p>Even without ‘Sprint’, he immediately reached his destination with anticipation . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the extraction target and gulped .  The monster’s corpse was exactly where he had left it . </p>
<p>‘ . Blood-red Ygritte . ’</p>
<p>Looking at the headless body half buried in the wall, Jinwoo remember just how fierce their battle was . </p>
<p>He stood before Ygritte . </p>
<p>Just a few hours ago, he was an enemy that threatened his life .  But now, the fallen knight was a top class ingredient for his skill .  Thankfully, like the other knights, there was a black smoke coming from Ygritte’s body . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>It’s a possible target for Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo’s face brightened . </p>
<p>‘Good . ’</p>
<p>He remembered the command phrase .  After taking a breath, Jinwoo quietly spoke the words,</p>
<p>“Arise . ”</p>
<p>That was the activation phrase he had chosen .  But the skill did not activate . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head in confusion and was about to try again when the System rang . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve exceeded the maximum number of Shadows allowed . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>To extract another Shadow, use ‘Extraction Cancel’ to send one or more Shadow Soldiers to the World of Nothingness . [1]</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Shadow Soldiers sent to the void cannot be summoned again . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Oh, right .  He did remember that part of the skill,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Maximum Shadows: 30 / 30</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The ‘Shadow Extraction’’s limit was 30 .  That meant the number of soldiers he made was exactly 30… Jinwoo turned around .  The Shadow Soldiers had followed him and were standing at attention . </p>
<p>‘When did they follow me?’</p>
<p>As fitting of their name, the Shadow Soldiers had moved without a sound .  Anyways, to extract Ygritte’s shadow, he had to get rid of one of them . </p>
<p>‘But…’</p>
<p>Even after meeting them only moments ago, it felt regrettable to get rid of one of his soldiers .  Had he gained a familiarity in that short time? With a sorrowful look, Jinwoo scanned each of the Shadow Soldiers .  As he moved from one to the next, their names and level appeared . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Shadow Infantry (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Normal Grade</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Shadow Infantry (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Normal Grade</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>They all had the same name and level . </p>
<p>‘Well, I guess their base was all same . ’</p>
<p>However, he did discover three soldiers that were not infantry . </p>
<p>‘Those are…?’</p>
<p>Unlike the armor-clad infantry, those three wore robes . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Shadow Mage (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Veteran Grade</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Ah . ”</p>
<p>He knew where these had come from .  The three mages that controlled the iron golem had also risen under his command . </p>
<p>‘27 infantry and 3 mages . ’</p>
<p>He determined that the small number of mages would have to be kept, so Jinwoo selected the nearest infantry . </p>
<p> . I’m sorry . </p>
<p>“Extraction Cancel . ”</p>
<p>vanish-</p>
<p>The soldier turned to smoke and scattered into nothingness .  Not a trace of it could be found . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo took a moment of silence for it, then turned to Ygritte .  He was ready . He had sacrificed a valuable soldier to make room for Ygritte, this better be worth it .  Time to strike while the iron’s hot . Jinwoo attempted the skill,</p>
<p>“Arise . ”</p>
<p>Compared to his previous attempt, the shadow beneath Ygritte began to quiver and move as if it was live .  It was the same phenomenon he saw when extracting the other soldiers . </p>
<p>‘It’s working!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo clenched his fists .  He had a good feeling about this . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Shadow Extraction has been attempted . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Extracting . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>What would Ygritte look like when he rose again? Sweat gathered in Jinwoo’s hands . </p>
<p>However . </p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>With a sound of metal breaking, a message appeared,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Shadow Extraction failed . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“What?”</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>2 attempts remaining . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Phew-”</p>
<p>He sighed in relief after seeing that he still had a chance . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it…’</p>
<p>The skill’s description did tell him that the success rate was dependent on the target’s abilities .  Seeing that in action was rather surprising . His first extraction failure . It was like being slapped in the face .  On top of that, there was a limit on the number of attempts . </p>
<p>‘Two attempts remaining…’</p>
<p>If he failed those 2 attempts, would Ygritte’s shadow return to the void like the sacrificed soldier? Jinwoo shuddered at the worst case scenario .  He shook his head,</p>
<p>‘Let’s not be pessimistic . ’</p>
<p>Be optimistic .  If he believed, perhaps the universe would help out .  Feeling a mix of dread and anticipation, Jinwoo tried the second attempt . </p>
<p>“Arise . ”</p>
<p>His expectations were off . </p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Shadow Extraction failed . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1 attempt remaining . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Ygritte was a pain in the ass while living, and he was equally annoying in death .  He thought of the worst case scenario again . After the second failure, the outcome looked bleak . </p>
<p>Whew-</p>
<p>Jinwoo took a deep breath .  There was only one chance left .  The last chance . Jinwoo closed his eyes and organized his thoughts . </p>
<p>‘It might just be based on a probability, but…’</p>
<p>He considered that maybe his desire for Ygritte’s shadow was not showing enough .  Jinwoo slowly opened his eyes . The black smoke coming from Ygritte looked like it was holding out a hand towards him, asking him to rescue the knight .  Jinwoo’s eyes became focused . As if to take the hand in rescue, Jinwoo also held out his right hand . </p>
<p>“Arise . ”</p>
<p>Something happened that Jinwoo did not mean to do .  Nor did he realize that it happened . But in that moment, the word he spoke echoed and vibrated with power . </p>
<p>And following his command!</p>
<p>Waaaaah-!</p>
<p>A deep scream rang forth from somewhere and a chilling wind followed . </p>
<p>‘This is?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s face lit up .  He remembered this phenomenon .  It was the same as when the soldiers rose earlier . </p>
<p>Aaaaaah-</p>
<p>As expected, when the scream ended, a hand rose from Ygritte’s shadow . </p>
<p>The moment the hand was placed on the ground, a message appeared . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve succeeded in Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo yelled in celebration . </p>
<p>“Alright!”</p>
<p>He clenched his fists .  Because he had failed twice, the success was all the more sweeter .  The good news did not stop there,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Monarch’s voice pulled forth the fighting spirit of the fallen one . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve succeeded in Shadow Strengthening!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Shadow’s level will start at 7 . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Succeeded in strengthening?’</p>
<p>Did this mean that they did not necessarily start at level 1? Jinwoo’s eyes were wide open .  As the message told him, the pitch black knight that rose from the shadow was level 7 . </p>
<p>“Mhmm!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo yelped lightly .  Ygritte’s form was exactly as he remembered .  The plumage that decorated its helmet . The nimble looking body covered from head to toe in armor .  It even maintained the classy cape it had taken off before the fight . Only difference was that instead of the blood-red color, it was pitch black all over .  Other than that, it was the same boss that he had defeated earlier . You could almost say that Ygritte had come back to life . </p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Compared to before, there was not a shred of hostility coming from the reborn Ygritte . </p>
<p>It stood at attention, waiting for an order . </p>
<p>ba dum ba dum</p>
<p>Looking at Ygritte, Jinwoo’s heart beat vigorously .  A smile decorated his face . At the same time, a question appeared in his mind .  Jinwoo looked above the knight’s head . </p>
<p>‘Why doesn’t he have a name?’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>??? (Lv . 7)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Knight Grade</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Curiously, question marks appeared where his name should be . </p>
<p>‘The grade is different, too . ’</p>
<p>He had expected it to be stronger because of his level, but there was a few more difference between him and the other soldiers .  As if reading his mind,</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You may assign a name to soldiers at or above the knight grade . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The given name will be maintained until the soldier is released . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Please choose a name for the soldier . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Name?’</p>
<p>He was unsure at first, but then realized this soldier did have his own name .  It wouldn’t be a problem if he called him by that name . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Please choose a name for the soldier . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As if asking him to hurry, the message was blinking rapidly .  Jinwoo opened his mouth,</p>
<p>“Blood-red Ygri- . ”</p>
<p>Wait . </p>
<p>If he assigned a name, he would have to constantly call it by that name .  That meant that if he assigned the name was thinking of, he would always have to start with “Blood-red” something .  He shuddered at how lame that sounded . </p>
<p>‘ . Too lame . ’</p>
<p>And so, Jinwoo decided to shortened the name a bit . </p>
<p>“Ygritte . ”</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to pick “Ygritte”?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>The moment he confirmed, the question marks in the knight’s name disappeared and were replaced with Ygritte . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Ygritte (Lv . 7)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Knight Grade</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Even though it was the knight’s original name, seeing his name officially decorate the information box gave Jinwoo a sense of pride .  It was as if the idea that the boss was now his soldier had solidified . </p>
<p>‘My soldier…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned around . </p>
<p>The 29 Shadow Soldiers awaited his command .  Right now, his army’s numbers were little . </p>
<p>‘Only thirty soldiers…’</p>
<p>It could’ve been because the ‘Shadow Extraction’’s level was too low, or it could’ve been that his intelligence stat was too low .  Still, Jinwoo was sure that the number of his army would only increase going forward . </p>
<p>‘I really obtained an army . ’</p>
<p>And contrary to what he had feared earlier, an army made of shadows, not bone and corpses . </p>
<p>Only one problem remained .  How would he walk around with these soldiers? It gave him a headache imagining walking down the road with the pitch black humanoids following . </p>
<p>‘Whether it’s skeletons or shadows…’</p>
<p>He would surely be noticed if these things were surrounding him .  Not only noticed… This ability was beyond Reawakening . If he was placed under special surveillance, people may even ask him to cancel the summoning . </p>
<p>‘Hunter Association HSD Chief Woo Jincheol…’</p>
<p>He imagined those military-looking ahjussis swarming him and felt stifled at the headache that would follow .  Thankfully, he had another skill . </p>
<p>‘Skill . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo opened up his skill screen . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Class-specific Skills</strong>.   </p>
<p>Active Skills</p>
<p>-Shadow Extraction (Lv . 1)</p>
<p>-Shadow Storage (Lv . 1)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The one that he hadn’t checked yet . </p>
<p>Shadow Storage . </p>
<p>It seemed like something that would be used in situations like this . </p>
<p>  . </p>
