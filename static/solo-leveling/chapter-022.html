<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 22</p>
<p>Good timing .  He was thirsty after the fight .  Still, Jinwoo took the cup with a confused look . </p>
<p>gulp gulp gulp</p>
<p>The cold water went down refreshingly down his throat . </p>
<p>“How is it, hyungnim?”</p>
<p>Now that he thought about, Jinho’s title for him had gone from “hyung” to “hyungnim” . </p>
<p>“Mm, it’s refreshing . ”</p>
<p>He returned the cup to Jinho . </p>
<p>“So what you just saw here-”</p>
<p>Jinho interrupted before Jinwoo could finish his sentence, almost as if to tell him not to worry . </p>
<p>“Of course! I’ll carry this secret with me to the grave . ”</p>
<p>“No, you don’t have to go that far…”</p>
<p>“How can I not? It’s my promise with hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>“Well… Okay . If you feel that way . ”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>Besides, there was no way someone would believe that an E-rank Hunter took down a C-rank Gate’s boss on his own .  Still, Jinwoo was thankful that Jinho promised his silence on his own . </p>
<p>‘Thought he was bad at taking a hint .  He sure doesn’t seem like it now . ’</p>
<p>“Is there anything else, hyungnim?”</p>
<p>“ . No . ”</p>
<p>It was strange .  Jinwoo looked up and down on Jinho’s figure that was standing at attention . </p>
<p>‘Well, I guess I did save his life . ’</p>
<p>After all, it was normal for someone to be respectful towards the person who saved their life .  It was understandable if that was the case . Of course, the truth was a little different . </p>
<p>shaaake~</p>
<p>The Dungeon lightly shook again, then stopped .  The shaking was the signal that the Gate would be closing soon .  The tremors would increase as time passed, until right before the Gate’s closing, when it would feel like an earthquake . </p>
<p>“Let’s go . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo started walking towards the blockage .  Suddenly, the collapsed rocks blew apart with a flash . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok and co . entered the boss room .  Seeing the collapsed spider behind Jinwoo, their looks were incredulous . </p>
<p>“What the, it’s dead?”</p>
<p>“Those two took it down?”</p>
<p>“Was the only thing scary its size?”</p>
<p>“Well, if it got taken down by an E-rank and a D-rank . ”</p>
<p>“Hwang hyung, what do we do now?”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok looked at Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho and scratched his chin .  With the spider dead, the Gate would close soon . It was too late to start mining the mana crystals now .  They weren’t prepared for it, and the time remaining was less than an hour . He had to change the plan . </p>
<p>He shouted toward Yoo Jinho,</p>
<p>“Yoo Jinho!”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho flinched and took a step backwards, face was full of nervousness . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok smirked,</p>
<p>“Your equipment really caught our eye, so we did a little investigation .  Your daddy turned out to be someone crazy! Yoojin Construction’s chairman, Yoo Myunghan . ”</p>
<p>“So- so what?”</p>
<p>“Well, we’re giving you a chance . We have some things we want to talk over with your daddy .  But if what happened here got out, our situation would become a little uncomfortable . So if you want to live, become our accomplice . ”</p>
<p>“An accomplice?”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok raised his chin towards Jinwoo .  At his unpleasant gaze, Jinwoo grimaced . </p>
<p>“Kill Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho panicked, but Hwang Dongseok looked at his face and laughed .  Their original plan was to kill Jinho as well . But they had discovered that Yoo Jinho’s father was the chairman of one of the top construction companies of the country .  With that in mind, a devious thought came to him . What if they filmed Yoo Jinho killing Sung Jinwoo, and used that to blackmail Yoo Myunghan?</p>
<p>‘Yoo Myunghan’s known net worth is about 10 trillion . ’</p>
<p>If everything went right, they could earn several times more than what they would’ve gotten from the mana crystals . </p>
<p>“That is your way out of here . We’ll let you live if you kill Sung Jinwoo with your own hands . Otherwise, we’ll kill you both . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok’s eyes became murderous . </p>
<p>“What are you waiting for? No one’s going to know what happened in a Dungeon anyways . Is a D-rank cowering before an E-rank?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho looked to his side .  Jinwoo just shrugged in response .  “Do what you want” was what he was telling him .  Yoo Jinho took out his sword with a determined face . </p>
<p>‘Looks like he made his decision . ’</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok smiled .  </p>
<p>But the results were not what he expected . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho took his sword and stood at Jinwoo’s side . </p>
<p>“Oh? Going to team up against us?”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok spoke to himself .  The young master sure got gutsy after luckily taking down a C-rank boss .  </p>
<p>Jo Gyuhwan whispered to him from his side,</p>
<p>“Hyung, what should we do?”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok whispered back,</p>
<p>“For now, take care of Sung Jinwoo . We’ll hold on to Mr . Moneybags for now . Our loss was too big today . ”</p>
<p>“Got it . ”</p>
<p>A bright light appeared in Jo Gyuhwan’s hands .  Jinwoo’s eyes narrowed . </p>
<p>‘So we’re doing it this way, after all . ’</p>
<p>This would be his first time fighting a Hunter .  However, he had no plans on being merciful to those who had threatened his life multiple times . </p>
<p>Suddenly!</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>The electronic sound rang in his head . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>An emergency quest has been created . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Emergency quest?’</p>
<p>He raised his head .  He did not give the command to open it, but the quest screen had opened up on its own .  This was the first time this had happened . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Emergency Quest: Deal With The Enemies!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Those with murderous intent towards the ‘Player’ have been detected .  Ensure your safety by dealing with these enemies . </strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Enemies to deal with: 8</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Enemies dealt with: 0</strong>.   </p>
<p>Non-compliance will result in a penalty . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes were open wide . </p>
<p>‘The quest requires me to kill Hwang Dongseok’s entire party?’</p>
<p>Something behind the screen flashed .  It was the arrow of light released from Jo Gyuhwan’s hands . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s body was thrown from the explosion and crashed into the wall with great speed . </p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>The wall broke apart on impact and the pieces landed on Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim!”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho tried to run to Jinwoo in panic, but Hwang Dongseok stopped him,</p>
<p>“Yoo Jinho!”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho flinched and stopped . </p>
<p>“You better not pay any mind to a dead person and come here . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok gestured him to come over .  Yoo Jinho turned and looked at where Jinwoo was .  Like Hwang Dongseok said, Jinwoo was buried in rocks and did not appear to be moving . </p>
<p>“You… you murderers…”</p>
<p>Tears gathered at the corner of Yoo Jinho’s eyes .  Hwang Dongseok and his party laughed at his words . </p>
<p>It was the truth, after all .  They lost count of the number of people they had killed in Dungeons . </p>
<p>As they laughed at Yoo Jinho, Jinwoo was questioning his eyes below the rubble .  This was because the quest’s contents were changing before his eyes . </p>

<p>It was a very clear threat, “I’ll kill you if you don’t do the quest . ”</p>
<p>‘Kill if I don’t want to be killed?’</p>
<p>It was a shocking message, but his confusion did not last long .  The confusion quickly turned to comfort . He could not believe it, but it was true .  From the day the quests and stat screens appeared, a single thought had plagued Jinwoo’s mind . </p>
<p>“What if this strange occurrence ends?”</p>
<p>If all this happened out of coincidence, could it end just as suddenly?</p>
<p>Such worrisome thought always followed him . </p>
<p>But now, with the appearance of this quest, he obtained a certainty . </p>
<p>This was neither coincidence or kindness .  </p>
<p>If the System came to him out of some kindness, it would’ve given him the option to avoid the danger .  It would not use a penalty to force him to kill . </p>
<p>The System had a goal . </p>
<p>Not “to make Sung Jinwoo become strong”, but “need Sung Jinwoo to become strong” . </p>
<p>‘Depending on the situation, even kill fellow Hunters…’</p>
<p>That was what he gathered from the appearance of the quest . </p>
<p>Still, Jinwoo found comfort in the thought . </p>
<p>‘Thank god . ’</p>
<p>Because it was not a coincidence . </p>
<p>There was a clear purpose . </p>
<p>Every time he faced danger, he wanted to become stronger .  He wanted the opportunity to rise above his life that felt like holding onto the edge of a cliff .  And on that day, in the most dangerous moment of his life, the opportunity came to him . </p>
<p>The System’s goals were perfectly aligned with Jinwoo’s desires . </p>
<p>‘The System uses me, and I’ll use the System . ’</p>
<p>That’s all he had to do .  As long as it had a goal, he would be able to hold on to this phenomenon . </p>
<p>Jinwoo rose from the rubble . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Health: 1360 / 2600</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He really did get hit by a C-rank Hunter’s magic .  A single hit took half of his life down . There was no room for error going forward .  A coldness crept into Jinwoo’s eyes . He began to walk towards Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Having surrounded the cowering Yoo Jinho, Hwang Dongseok’s party noticed Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“What the, he’s alive?”</p>
<p>“Gyuhwan hyung, looks like you’ve lost your touch . ”</p>
<p>“How embarrassing, against an E-ranker, too . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok scratched his chin,</p>
<p>“Gyuhwan, do it right next time . ”</p>
<p>Jo Gyuhwan’s face reddened with embarrassment,</p>
<p>“I-I got it . ”</p>
<p>No .  He definitely used his most powerful spell .  It was an attack that used up a third of his magic power, how could he get up? Did he miss? No, if he missed, it wouldn’t have made such a loud sound .  He had many questions but did not get the chance to ask . </p>
<p>Because Jinwoo was the first to speak,</p>
<p>“You’ve played with people’s lives . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok’s group’s eyes were fixed on Jinwoo .  Jinwoo stopped before them . Yoo Jinho was surprised, but the other Hunters were nonchalant .  Few of them even had a mocking expression . </p>
<p>Jinwoo continued dryly,</p>
<p>“You’re ready to pay the price, right?”</p>
<p>At that phrase, Hwang Dongseok snorted . </p>
<p>“The hell is this fucker saying?”</p>
<p>“Hyungnim, I got this . ”</p>
<p>A Hunter with narrow eyes went over and draped an arm around Jinwoo’s neck . </p>
<p>“It looks like you’re not really understanding the situation here,”</p>
<p>The narrow-eye’s expression became strange as he put strength on his arm . </p>
<p>‘ . What? Why is he not bending?’</p>
<p>He used all of his strength to try and put Jinwoo in a headlock, but no matter how much he flexed, Jinwoo’s body did not bend . </p>
<p>Wasn’t this fucker an E-rank?</p>
<p>The narrow-eye’s brows moistened with cold sweat . </p>
<p>‘What’s with this pow-’</p>
<p>slash . </p>
<p>The narrow-eye’s head fell onto the ground . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>“J-Joontae!”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok’s eyes shook . </p>
<p>“Wait, what?”</p>
<p>“When did that fucker get a dagger?!”</p>
<p>“Where did it come from?!”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok’s party quickly drew their weapons and took a step back .  In Jinwoo’s hand was Casaka’s Poisoned Fang he had summoned from his inventory . </p>
<p>The dagger dripped with blood . </p>
