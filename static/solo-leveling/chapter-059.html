<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 59</p>
<p>“A Red Gate? How did this happen?”</p>
<p>Baekho’s Guildmaster Baek Yoonho immediately came to the scene after receiving the news .  Hyun Gicheol, the man in charge of the training, had a dark expression . </p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“Let me take a look . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho walked past the employees, who were practically preparing for a funeral in their minds, and walked up to the Gate . </p>
<p>‘It’s really a Red Gate!’</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho’s face hardened . </p>
<p>Red Gates .  It was a terrifying phenomenon observed in random high-level Gates .  Instead of taking you to a small and confined Dungeon, it would connect to an entirely different world, complete with their own environments and lifeforms .  Once the Gate solidified in its red color, no one could enter or leave until the boss was taken down or a Dungeon Break occurred . It was completely closed off from the outside . </p>
<p>Baek Yoonho placed a hand on the Gate .  It was definitely blocked . </p>
<p>‘This is not good . ’</p>
<p>There was nothing they could do .  Unlike other emergencies, help could not be provided to the ones inside .  Baek Yoonho turned to Hyun Gicheol,</p>
<p>“Was this not a C-rank Gate?”</p>
<p>“It was . ”</p>
<p>“Did you confirm with the Association?”</p>
<p>“We did, but… They were unusually adamant that this was a C-rank Gate . ”</p>
<p>“Those fucking sons of bitches!”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho swore loudly .  The Red Gates were a phenomenon limited to high-level Gates .  It would take you to an entirely different world on the other side, and they said the magic power seeping out was only that of a C-rank Gate? It was an unthinkable bullshit .  The Gate in front of him was at minimum, a B-rank . If they were unlucky, it could be an A-rank . If they were really unlucky, something above that . </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was a reason why the Association could stubbornly deny any wrongdoing . </p>
<p>“Should we measure it with our own devices?”</p>
<p>At Hyun Gicheol’s question, Baek Yoonho shook his head,</p>
<p>“No, Red Gates stop seeping magic power after solidifying . It’s impossible to measure it now . ”</p>
<p>And this is why the Association could deny everything .  It was impossible to remeasure a Red Gate, so there would be no evidence that they had messed up their initial measurements .  Regardless, the rank of the Gate was not important right now,</p>
<p>“How many of our own went in?”</p>
<p>“Twelve, sir . ”</p>
<p>‘How many were high-rankers?”</p>
<p>“The A-rank Hunter Kim Cheol-nim took the lead, and seven B-rank Hunter-nims below him . ”</p>
<p>“One A-rank and seven B-ranks…”</p>
<p>“Do… do you think the recruits will be alright?”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho shook his head . </p>
<p>“We can consider them dead . If we’re lucky, the A-ranker and few B-rankers might come back alive . ”</p>
<p>If they were lucky . </p>
<p>The composition of the party that went in would have a difficult time clearing the easiest of B-rank Dungeons .  Anything beyond that was impossible . Without a miracle, the possibility of the new recruits coming back alive was slim .  Baek Yoonho’s face darkened . Reading the mood, Hyung Gicheol carefully spoke up,</p>
<p>“Er… So… there are two others that entered with our new recruits . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho raised his head .  Did a passing high-ranker tag along out of curiosity? That indeed would be a miracle! Baek Yoonho’s voice became louder,</p>
<p>“Who was it?!”</p>
<p>“He’s the Hunter that’s been on my sights recently . ”</p>
<p>The reply came from their side .  Both Hyun Gicheol and Baek Yoonho turned their heads to face Ahn Sangmin .  The division chief was drenched in sweat and was panting . </p>
<p>“Sorry for being late . There was a little traffic . ”</p>
<p>Because he lived the furthest away from the scene of the incident, Ahn Sangmin had arrived the latest .  The man glanced at the Gate . The phenomenon that was like a door to another world was now an iron wall, cutting everyone off from the other side .  Just looking at it made it hard for an ordinary person to breathe . </p>
<p>‘But if it’s Hunter Sung Jinwoo…’</p>
<p>The man who had triumphed over incident after incident .  That man just might be able to surpass everyone’s expectations here .  Baek Yoonho quickly approached Ahn Sangmin,</p>
<p>“He’s a Hunter that Chief Ahn had his eyes on?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir . ”</p>
<p>Ah .  Baek Yoonho remembered the whispers around the office . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it…’</p>
<p>Lately, people were talking about how Chief Ahn was coming and leaving the office in a hurry .  As expected, it was for the recruitment of a new Hunter . The man’s eyes were never wrong . </p>
<p>‘Could it be…’</p>
<p>The fires of hope lit up in Baek Yoonho’s chest . </p>
<p>“What’s the Hunter’s rank? A? Or maybe B?”</p>
<p>It couldn’t have been S .  There had only been 10 S-rank Hunters born in South Korea; every single one of them knew each other .  But Ahn Sangmin shook his head!</p>
<p>‘My god!’</p>
<p>The hardened face of Baek Yoonho relaxed in an instant,</p>
<p>“Are you telling me an S-ranker went in with them?”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin calmly replied,</p>
<p>“No sir . He’s an E-ranker . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho looked like he had swallowed a bug . </p>
<p>Jinwoo was surprised . </p>
<p>‘So this is the other world that they talked about?’</p>
<p>This was his first time seeing it person, but Jinwoo had read up on the Red Gates on the internet in the past .  They all used the expression of being “sucked in” . Jinwoo agreed . When the Gate seemingly grabbed onto his hand and pulled him in, all he saw for a moment was darkness, and it felt like he was sliding down a tunnel . </p>
<p>‘Holy!’</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, he was in the middle of a forest covered in snow . </p>
<p>“Where are we?!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is a Dungeon . ”</p>
<p>“The Gate is gone!”</p>
<p>The other Hunters looked around and could not hide their panic .  While they were in chaos, Jinwoo calmly looked around with narrowed eyes . </p>
<p>‘I don’t sense anything weird . ’</p>
<p>Thanks to the System, even in a situation like this, he was able to remain calm .  First thing that he analyzed was the trees . Giant evergreens, impossibly large to be found in their country, covered the landscape, reaching high into the sky .  The top of the trees were stacked with snow . He lowered his gaze and met someone else’s eyes . It was the A-rank Hunter Kim Cheol, who had also been surveilling the surroundings . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>The two stared down at each other, then looked away .  Han Songyi approached Jinwoo and lightly tugged on his clothes . </p>
<p>“Excuse me… Something went wrong, right?”</p>
<p>Her eyes were filled with fear .  The confidence she displayed outside was completely gone .  Suddenly, Jinwoo’s hand shot toward her face . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>The girl’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>grab!</p>
<p>The arrow Jinwoo caught lightly trembled as if angry at not hitting its target .  The target was Han Songyi’s forehead . </p>
<p>“Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>Realizing what just happened, Han Songyi’s face turned white .  However, the scream that rang forth did not come from her . </p>
<p>“Kiyaaaaah!”</p>
<p>“U-uwak!”</p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>Blood seep out the Hunter’s mouth as he fell to the ground, an arrow sticking out of his temple .  A crimson flower bloomed on top of the snow . The Hunters began to moan in fear . The two arrows had flown toward them at the same time .  Thanks to that, most of them did not see Jinwoo catch the other arrow . </p>
<p>“Over there!”</p>
<p>“It was them!”</p>
<p>A B-rank Hunter pointed toward a faint spot on top of a distant tree .  Long before he pointed, Jinwoo and Kim Cheol’s eyes were already looking in the direction .  There were two people standing on top of the trees . </p>
<p>‘Or rather, they certainly aren’t people . ’</p>
<p>White hair .  Skin as pale as snow .  Silver eyes . And the trademark of their race, pointed ears . </p>
<p>Because of their fair beauty and the fact that you could only see them in high-level Dungeons, they were quite famous among the magic beasts . </p>
<p>‘Ice elf . ’</p>
<p>Also known as the White Walkers . [1]</p>
<p>Those that never met them in person refer to them as ice elves .  However, those that have faced them directly in battle called them White Walkers .  Their reasoning was that a pretty name like “elf” was not fitting for these things .  Jinwoo was able to understand why the Hunter sunbaes called these things White Walkers while gritting their teeth . </p>
<p>‘ . They’re laughing at us . ’</p>
<p>The two elves had lowered their bows and were laughing disgustingly at the Hunters .  It was as if they were deciding which food to eat first at a buffet . </p>
<p>‘And this was your decision?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes became sharp .  An arrow to the right of the party .  An arrow to the left of the party . Their targets were not random .  The Hunter killed by the arrow was a newly Awakened C-ranker in his 30s .  Other than Han Songyi, he was the weakest of the group . And the other arrow was aimed at…</p>
<p>‘Han Songyi . ’</p>
<p>The elves had targeted the two weakest members of their party . </p>
<p>‘If it wasn’t for the System, I would’ve been the other target . ’</p>
<p>The White Walkers’ calculating ways annoyed Jinwoo .  Making sure they could see him, Jinwoo held out the arrow and crushed it in his hand . </p>
<p>crack!</p>
<p>Accepting the challenge, one of the White Walkers slid a finger across his throat .  Even between human and magic beast, it was a universal gesture . </p>
<p>Jinwoo’s mouth formed a smile .  His eyes were not smiling . </p>
<p>‘ . You . I will kill you myself . ’</p>
<p>At a mere magic beast’s taunt, Jinwoo’s eyes filled with a cold fury .  The White Walkers quickly disappeared behind the tree . </p>
<p>“I don’t think they’re here to be friends . ”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol finally opened his mouth .  As he was the sole A-ranker of the party, everyone turned their eyes to him .  He was technically the leader of this Raid after all . </p>
<p>“I’m sure some of you noticed . This is a Red Gate . ”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol spoke in a condescending manner, but nobody dared to complain . </p>
<p>“That means that until we are all dead or a Dungeon Break occurs, no one will be coming for us . ”</p>
<p>Many of the Hunters groaned in defeat .  Some of the ignorant ones had hoped for a rescue, and the fact that no such help would be coming crushed their spirits .  Kim Cheol continued,</p>
<p>“If we stay here, we’ll either freeze to death or be ambushed by those bastards . I will go and clear this Dungeon to leave . Who’s with me?”</p>
<p>With wide shoulders and a powerful look in his eyes, Kim Cheol looked rather dependable .  After a brief pause, the Hunters approached the man in unison,</p>
<p>“I’ll go . ”</p>
<p>“Me too please . ”</p>
<p>“Let’s leave here alive . ”</p>
<p>“I’ll help as well!”</p>
<p>However, Kim Cheol shoved a man who had approached him . </p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>He had held back, but it was the power of an A-ranker .  The man walked backwards while clutching his chest in pain . </p>
<p>“Not you . ”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“And you, you, you and you . ”</p>
<p>In addition to the man, Kim Cheol pointed to several others, including Jinwoo and Han Songyi .  Jinwoo’s eyes twitched, realizing Kim Cheol’s intentions . The musclehead had pointed to a total of 5 people .  They were the C-rank and below Hunters . </p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we cannot take you with us . ”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“What do you know of Red Gates?”</p>
<p>The man shook his head . </p>
<p>“A day in here is an hour outside . Worst case scenario, it’ll take months before either we take down the boss or a Dungeon Break occurs . With that in mind, we can’t babysit you all . ”</p>
<p>“What do you mean babysit us?!”</p>
<p>The Hunters that would be excluded tried to protest but were silenced when Kim Cheol gave a fierce look with his eyes .  With a false kindness, Kim Cheol continued,</p>
<p>“Don’t feel bad . All you have to do is survive until we take down the boss . ”</p>
<p>“Still…”</p>
<p>The excluded Hunters looked toward the other Hunters in Kim Cheol’s group pleadingly, but not one of the stepped forward .  They all looked away . Except one . </p>
<p>“Excuse me . ”</p>
<p>A female B-ranker in Kim Cheol’s team raised a hand . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>When Kim Cheol turned around, the woman gestured to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“We can go from here to there, right?”</p>
<p>“ . If you want . ”</p>
<p>Without a hesitation, the woman walked over to Jinwoo’s side .  Kim Cheol looked back and forth between the woman and Jinwoo . The A-ranker snorted then spoke with a loud voice,</p>
<p>“Well, looks like we have a spot open . We’ll take one more from your end . ”</p>
<p>“M-me!”</p>
<p>The man who was shoved earlier quickly ran over to Kim Cheol’s side .  That’s how it should be, Jinwoo thought . </p>
<p>‘This woman’s the weird one . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the woman at his side with a suspicious gaze .  Meeting his eyes, the woman quietly spoke so no one else could hear,</p>
<p>“That man, Kim Cheol, he didn’t see the arrow coming . ”</p>
<p>Just because you were a high-ranker, didn’t mean that all your stats were evenly distributed .  Kim Cheol’s agility stat might’ve been low . Knowing the power of the different stats, Jinwoo did not give it much thought . </p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>The woman smiled widely,</p>
<p>“You . You’re not an E-rank, are you?”</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “White Walkers” (백귀): One way to translate is the Japanese phrase for “Hyakki Yako”, aka the “Procession of Hundred Demons” .  It’s also could be referring to Korean translation of “White Walkers” from Game of Thrones . I decided to go with the latter . With “Ygritte” and “White Walkers”, I think the author might be a fan of the show . </p>
