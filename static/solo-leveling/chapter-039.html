<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 39</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin was at a complete loss for words .  The maximum amount of profit you could earn in a C-rank Gate was 200 million .  To use 250 million on such a Gate was utter foolishness . </p>
<p>“Their original bid was about seventy million . But when I outbid them with a hundred million, those bastards raised their bid to two hundred and fifty million . ”</p>
<p>In Baekho Guild, the default maximum for reserving C-rank Gates was 100 million .  If what he said was true, it was reasonable for Hyun Gicheol to feel wronged . </p>
<p>‘Who the hell are these bastards?’</p>
<p>clack clack clack</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin’s fingers blazed across the keyboard .  The search results immediately came up on the screen .  As Hyun Gicheol had said, the raiding permissions for all the C-rank Gates in the area were being bought out at an incredible speed and an unreasonable price . </p>
<p>“Who the hell are these crazy sons of…”</p>
<p>This area was under the management of the Baekho Guild .  At first, he thought it might’ve been another Guild’s way of hindering the Guild . </p>
<p>‘No, there’s no way . ’</p>
<p>There was no Guild stupid enough to start a fight with the Baekho Guild .  Even the other top 5 Guilds would have to be prepared for an all out war if they did something like this . </p>
<p>‘It’s not a Guild…’</p>
<p>Then who? And why?</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin gulped and pulled up the party information of the ones who reserved all the Gates .  The leader’s name was “Yoo Jinho” . </p>
<p>“First time I’m hearing of him . ”</p>
<p>It was Ahn Sangmin’s job to scout potential new recruits .  As such, even a freelancer with the smallest amount of fame would be known to him .  But the name “Yoo Jinho” was completely unfamiliar to him . </p>
<p>‘Ok, next . ’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin slowly scrolled through rest of the party members, confirming each Hunter one at a time .  There was not one that he recognized . </p>
<p>Except one . </p>
<p>One of the names was familiar to him . </p>
<p>‘Sung Jinwoo? Sung Jinwoo… Where did I hear that name before…?’</p>
<p>After combing through his memories, Ahn Sangmin remembered the Double Dungeon incident 2 months ago, which became a hot topic among those involved .  The Guild that was pulled into assistance by the Association at the time was Baekho . </p>
<p>“Gicheol, do you remember the Double Dungeon incident two months ago, when our Guild was called to mobilization?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course . Didn’t we find only one survivor in the Dungeon with no magic beasts?”</p>
<p>“What was the survivor’s name?”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol had a good head .  He could not be called a genius, but his memory was the one thing he was proud of .  The man did not need to perform a search or look through any documents . </p>
<p>“E-rank Hunter, Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>‘As I thought!’</p>
<p>He had wondered about the possibility and came to a conclusion through intuition .  There was something here . The gut feeling that appeared in situations like this had never steered him wrong .  Ahn Sangmin shouted to the rest of his team,</p>
<p>“Everyone stop what you’re doing and bring me every single bit of information on D-rank Hunter Yoo Jinho and E-rank Hunter Sung Jinwoo! Right now!”</p>
<p>The response speed of the employees at this sudden order was beyond imagination .  They were called elites for a reason . One by one, the reports quickly appeared before Ahn Sangmin . </p>
<p>To be honest, there was nothing that special about Yoo Jinho .  He was the second son of Yoojin Construction’s Chairman Yoo Myunghan, but other than that, there was nothing noticeable about him . </p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo was different . </p>
<p>“So including the Double Dungeon incident, he’s been involved in a total of three different incidents . And he came out of every one of them unharmed?”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol added on,</p>
<p>“And as an E-rank Hunter, too . ”</p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho met during Yoo Jinho’s first Raid, and they were the only ones who survived that Raid . </p>
<p>And now, the pair had formed a team and was clearing 2~3 Dungeons a day .  This was an unfathomable speed . </p>
<p>“Something about this smells…”</p>
<p>“What do you think they’re doing?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Wait, wasn’t there a rumor recently that Chairman Yoo Myunghan was making contact with various S-rank Hunters?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that rumor, yes . ”</p>
<p>“And Yoo Jinho is that Chairman Yoo Myunghan’s son…”</p>
<p>It appeared that Yoo Myunghan planned to make a Guild .  This would be a top secret information that would shake the industry .  And if this was true, Yoo Jinho’s current actions would definitely be related . </p>
<p>“Could it be…?!”</p>
<p>A piece of the puzzle fell into place in Ahn Sangmin’s head . </p>
<p>That would make sense! Watching his superior’s expressions change, Hyun Gicheol gulped .  Ahn Sangmin spoke with a confident voice,</p>
<p>“This son of a bitch is a Reawakened Hunter!”</p>
<p>“A Reawakened Hunter?!”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol’s looked like a deer in headlights . </p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>An E-rank Hunter was barely above an ordinary person .  If there was an accident, they were all but counted as dead .  But Sung Jinwoo had gone through multiple incidents where his teammates had died without being harmed . </p>
<p>‘Of course, he could just be lucky as hell, but,’</p>
<p>The third incident . </p>
<p>The incident where Hunter Surveillance Department Hunter Kang Taeshik committed murder was different .  The records showed that a C-rank Mage and a B-rank Healer teamed up to defeat Kang Taeshik . </p>
<p>‘There’s no way . The HSD Hunters’ primary job is to fight other Hunters . ’</p>
<p>Unless Kang Taeshik was a moron, he would’ve tried to take care of the one with the highest rank but lowest combat ability, the B-rank Healer, first . </p>
<p>‘And they say a C-rank Mage-class Hunter stopped him from doing that?’</p>
<p>Mage-class Hunters were weak against Fighter-class Hunters, and among them, their worst possible match-up would be against the Assassin-class .  Perhaps Kang Taeshik could’ve arrogantly ignored the presence of the B-rank Healer, but it was unlikely that a 3-year veteran of the HSD would make such a mistake . </p>
<p>‘The person who stopped Kang Taeshik on that day was not the C-rank Song Chiyeol, but someone else who was with them . ’</p>
<p>There was no solid proof, but Ahn Sangmin was certain of his theory . </p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo had Reawakened as a high-ranking Hunter .  Yoo Jinho had witnessed his power in their Raid and decided to test him to place him in his father’s Guild .  Everything fell into place . </p>
<p>‘This is big news . ’</p>
<p>If Sung Jinwoo truly was a Reawakened Hunter, the only ones who knew his true value were Yoo Jinho and few others .  Knowing public image of Yoo Myunghan, the man would not carelessly accept anyone into his Guild, especially as a founding member .  This would be an opportunity to steal away a talent that THE Yoo Myunghan had picked . </p>
<p>‘If he defeated the B-ranker Kang Taeshik, he’s at least above a B-ranker!’</p>
<p>Their priority now would be to obtain Sung Jinwoo before the other Guilds and especially Yoo Myunghan could .  The competition would become fierce after Sung Jinwoo’s retest . Even if the man did not turn out to be that highly ranked, it would not matter .  As their numbers across the world was incredibly small, a Reawakened Hunter would be prime target of the press . That alone would make the man an incredible source of advertising power, one that could not be bought with money . </p>
<p>This was not an opportunity Baekho could pass up on . </p>
<p>‘Well, if he already signed the contract with Yoo Myunghan, it’s too late…’</p>
<p>But there was low chance of that . </p>
<p>The fact that Sung Jinwoo was being tested through C-rank Gates was the proof . </p>
<p>‘There’s a good chance that there’s nothing set in stone . ’</p>
<p>This meant that the Baekho Guild still had a chance . </p>
<p>‘There’s no time to waste,’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin grabbed his coat on his chair . </p>
<p>“Gicheol, let’s go . ”</p>
<p>He needed his right hand man for this .  Hyun Gicheol was a man Ahn Sangmin would trust with his back . </p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol was surprised,</p>
<p>“Sir? Where are we going, chief?”</p>
<p>“Where do you think? Recruitment!”</p>
<p>“The chief himself is going out for recruitment?”</p>
<p>“Of course, is that not allowed?”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin quickly turned to leave .  Hyun Gicheol followed him with a tilted head . </p>
<p>‘How strange…’</p>
<p>Since he became chief 2 years ago, this was the first time Ahn Sangmin directly went out for recruitment . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>-7 . The Premonition of Success-</p>
<p>From their investigation, the Baekho employees learned that Yoo Jinho’s team had reserved two Gates today .  The distance between the Gates were quite far . Ahn Sangmin and Hyun Gicheol split up and went to separate Gates to confirm Ahn Sangmin’s theory .  The pair occasionally contacted each other and waited for Yoo Jinho’s team to appear . </p>
<p>‘It’s still a little cold…’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin grabbed a canned coffee from a nearby vending machine .  It had been 1 hour since he started waiting for Yoo Jinho’s team . But more than boredom, he was filled with anticipation .  His heart raced in excitement . </p>
<p>‘If I’m correct, this’ll be the first great recruit in a while . A special one at that!’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin had become the head of the division at a young age, faster than anyone else .  This was all thanks to his great instinct . His contribution was crucial in helping the Baekho Guild grow to what it was today .  And now his instincts were telling him:</p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo was someone who could raise Baekho to greater heights . </p>
<p>‘They’ll probably call me crazy if I said that out loud…’</p>
<p>After all, Sung Jinwoo was officially just an E-rank Hunter .  But not everything was as they appeared . If it were so, he would not be where he was .  As he surveyed the Gate with hawk-like eyes, his phone rang . </p>
<p>ring ring</p>
<p>It was Hyun Gicheol . </p>
<p>“Oy, Gicheol . ”</p>
<p>- “Chief, Yoo Jinho’s team just arrived . ”</p>
<p>“Got it . Don’t panic and report everything you see, don’t leave out a single detail . ”</p>
<p>- “Yes, chief . Eh? What? C-chief!”</p>
<p>The voice on the other end became strange . </p>
<p>‘Did this idiot get caught?’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin became worried,</p>
<p>“What is it? Talk! Talk!”</p>
<p>- “Chief, you were right!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin’s heartbeat became faster . </p>
<p>- “It’s just Yoo Jinho and Sung Jinwoo! They’re the only ones entering the Gate!”</p>
<p>“Of course! It’s was all to test Sung Jinwoo!”</p>
<p>As expected!</p>
<p>His guesses were right on the mark .  His instincts had not failed him . </p>
<p>‘Perfect!’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin pumped his fists . </p>
<p>‘While you’re busy testing the man, Sung Jinwoo will become ours!’</p>
<p>Because Baekho Guild’s Second Management Division had Ahn Sangmin!</p>
<p>While Ahn Sangmin was celebrating his victory, Hyun Gicheol’s voice continued . </p>
<p>- “So what should I do? Should I come to you?”</p>
<p>“No, no . Watch them for a bit longer . ”</p>
<p>- “Sir? Didn’t we confirm your theory?”</p>
<p>“I’m curious about their clearing time . How many hours do you think it’ll take them to clear a C-rank Dungeon?”</p>
<p>- “Doesn’t it take even an A-rank Hunter about two hours to solo clear a C-rank Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“You don’t think they can do it?”</p>
<p>- “Of course not . I was just worried that you’ll be lonely while waiting . ”</p>
<p>The ability to change his attitude in a flash .  This was why Ahn Sangmin could not get mad at Hyun Gicheol . </p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me . Just watch them closely and time them when they come out . ”</p>
