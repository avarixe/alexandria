<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 65</p>
<p>On the drive home . </p>
<p>zooom-</p>
<p>The face of the van’s driver was clouded with disappointment . </p>
<p>‘Sigh…’</p>
<p>Was it because the extraction target’s abilities were far greater than his own? Unfortunately, Jinwoo had failed in the Shadow Extraction of the ice elf boss . </p>
<p>‘Shame, but what can I do…’</p>
<p>Surely, the opportunity to take down another high-level boss would come again someday .  The important thing was that when that opportunity came again, he would be strong enough to not fail . </p>
<p>Level-up . </p>
<p>It was something he was quite good at . </p>
<p>Still, the Raid wasn’t all for naught .  He took his left hand off of the steering wheel; an elegant, curved dagger appeared in it . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Baruka’s Tanto [1]</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: A</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Dagger</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Attack Power +110</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Agility +10</strong>.   </p>
<p>It is the tanto wielded by the great warrior, Baruka .  A magical enchantment makes both the dagger and the wielder more agile . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo had not left the Dungeon empty-handed .  While one of the twin daggers wielded by the boss was destroyed by Knight Killer, he had claimed the unbroken one as his own . </p>
<p>‘Baruka’s Tanto . ’</p>
<p>It had the highest attack power out of all the daggers he had found so far; on top of that, it even had an effect of increasing his agility .  It was obviously better than the C-rank Casaka’s Poisoned Fang, and even the B-rank Knight Killer, bought with gold, could not compare to it . An A-rank dagger! It was the perfect weapon to replace Casaka’s Poisoned Fang, which was gradually losing its effectiveness in battle . </p>
<p>‘The grip doesn’t feel bad either . ’</p>
<p>While he was going over the events of the Red Gate, the van had arrived in front of Han Songyi’s house . </p>
<p>screech . </p>
<p>The student, who was silent throughout the entire ride, bowed her head to Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“Then, take care . ”</p>
<p>“Okay . ”</p>
<p>Watching the girl walk back to her house with sunken shoulders, Jinwoo felt like he had accomplished his mission . </p>
<p>‘Things got a little complicated, but the original goal was to convince Han Songyi . ’</p>
<p>It looked like the girl would not be continuing as a Hunter anymore .  Well, anyone whose first ever Dungeon was a Red Gate would do the same .  Jinwoo was about to drive away in satisfaction when the passenger door opened . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>He turned to see Han Songyi holding the door open . </p>
<p>‘What’s wrong with her?’</p>
<p>His curiosity only lasted for a brief moment .  The girl deeply bowed her head again,</p>
<p>“Thank you for today, oppa . ”</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, her title for him had changed from “ahjussi” to “oppa” . </p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, no problem . ”</p>
<p>“So…”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I’ll see you tomorrow- I mean, few hours from now . ”</p>
<p>Few hours from now?</p>
<p>Before he could ask her what she meant, Han Songyi ran inside .  After she disappeared into her home, Jinwoo realized,</p>
<p>‘Oh right . ’</p>
<p>It was already dawn, but the Raids with Yoo Jinho would resume today .  As Han Songyi was still part of their raiding party, they would see each other again . </p>
<p>‘That’s what she meant . ’</p>
<p>Oh shit… If Han Songyi completely retired from anything related to Hunters, Yoo Jinho’s team would’ve lost a team member, and it would’ve delayed their plans .  Thankfully, it looked like the girl would at least finish the remaining Raids . </p>
<p>‘Thank god . ’</p>
<p>With the Shadow Soldiers, the clearing speed of the C-rank Dungeons would rise a level higher .  Jinwoo was confident he could complete the remaining Raids in a record time . He was also looking forward to Yoo Jinho’s reaction when the young man saw the Shadow Soldiers . </p>
<p>‘That man, Yoon Gijoong, his reactions were top notch . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo grinned widely while turning the steering wheel . </p>
<p>Few hours later . </p>
<p>“Yawn-”</p>
<p>Jinwoo arrived at the lobby of his apartment while yawning .  When he opened his eyes after a brief nap, it was already the promised time . </p>
<p>“Good morning, hyungnim!”</p>
<p>A familiar voice filled with energy greeted him .  Yoo Jinho was already waiting for him . </p>
<p>“I took the car . How’d you get here?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo had borrowed the workhorse of their raiding party, “Bongo”, for last night’s events .  The van was parked nearby . </p>
<p>“A taxi, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, taxi . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo had hoped to flip their positions for once and go pick up the young man . </p>
<p>“It’s okay, hyungnim . I’m the one receiving your help . I should be the one accommodating you . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho spoke while chortling .  After a one day break, their morning exchanges had resumed as normal . </p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho discovered something .  Jinwoo was holding something cylindrical in his hand .  The young man asked curiously,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim, what’s that?”</p>
<p>“What, this?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled widely,</p>
<p>“I’m going to use it in the Dungeon today . ”</p>
<p>Holy… Yoo Jinho’s stomach fluttered . </p>
<p>‘Is it a weapon to be used in the Dungeon?’</p>
<p>Hyungnim always showed off something crazy in Dungeons .  Just what kind of a terrifying weapon was he holding now? Yoo Jinho already began to feel anxious . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho gathered his courage then raised his head,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim, let us go . ”</p>
<p>“Hold on . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo put up a hand, then took out his phone . </p>
<p>“We’ll be picking up someone on the way . ”</p>
<p>“Huh? Who?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo ignored him and spoke into the phone,</p>
<p>“Yeah, Songyi, it’s me . We’ll pick you up and take you to the Gate . ”</p>
<p>Songyi… That Songyi? When Jinwoo hung up, Yoo Jinho asked,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim, is the person we’re picking up our team’s highschool student?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded .  Since she lived really closed to his house, he felt like it would be efficient to just pick her up before leaving the area .  However, as he had done in the past, Yoo Jinho completely misread Jinwoo’s intents . </p>
<p>Han Songyi . </p>
<p>A cute-looking girl with short hair falling just below her ears . </p>
<p>‘If hyungnim knows her number and talked to her with such familiarity… Is their relationship like… that?’</p>
<p>As he had always known, hyungnim was an amazing man . </p>
<p>‘Especially when I watch him go to work on giant magic beasts with a single dagger…’</p>
<p>The young man was sure his hyungnim had no interest, but it made sense that the female student would fall for his hyungnim .  Yoo Jinho nodded to himself . If that was the case, there was something he had to clear up,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim, so should I be addressing Ms . Han Songyi as “missus” from now on?” [2]</p>
<p>What the fuck . </p>
<p>Was what Jinwoo’s eyes were saying .  Even Yoo Jinho, who was terrible at taking hints, was able to read as much from the man’s expression . </p>
<p>“Er… Were you two not dating?”</p>
<p>“She’s just my little sister’s friend . ”</p>
<p>“Oh . Oooooh . ”</p>
<p>So that’s what it was .  Yoo Jinho finally understood the situation .  To think that he accidentally almost called her his sister-in-law .  The young man’s face turned red with embarrassment . </p>
<p>Soon, Hang Songyi came down from her apartment .  Compared to their previous meetings, the girl appeared to have paid a little more attention to her looks this time .  Yoo Jinho smiled,</p>
<p>‘She’s just like a teenager who wants to show off before her friend’s oppa . ’</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho was about to act like a leader and compliment the girl’s clothes when Jinwoo greeted her first,</p>
<p>“Did you get some sleep?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho’s face froze . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Han Songyi smiled and shook her head,</p>
<p>“I couldn’t sleep a wink . ”</p>
<p>“You must be tired, get some shut-eye in the car . ”</p>
<p>At the pair’s conversation, Yoo Jinho’s mind became more and more chaotic . </p>
<p>‘Huh? Huuuuuh?’</p>
<p>Han Songyi asked Jinwoo a question,</p>
<p>“Oppa, did you get any sleep?”</p>
<p>“Just a quick nap . It was already 4AM when I got home . ”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Couldn’t sleep? Must be tired? 4AM? Yoo Jinho’s confusion turned to horror .  Jinwoo was heading toward the Bongo and turned around,</p>
<p>“Yoo Jinho, are you coming?”</p>
<p>“Err… Hyungnim?”</p>
<p>“ . ?”</p>
<p>“That’s er… Ms . Han Songyi is underage, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>What the fuck . </p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“ . Nevermind, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>As expected, hyungnim was the manliest of men .  Yoo Jinho was in awe of Jinwoo’s personality that gave no thoughts to society’s rules . </p>
<p>‘He’s truly not a normal man . ’</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho berated himself for judging his hyungnim with laws of ordinary people . [3]</p>
<p>At the same hour . </p>
<p>Baekho Guild’s Meeting Room . </p>
<p>“-And that’s pretty much all I saw . ”</p>
<p>Park Heejin finished recounting the events of the Red Gate .  Before she began, Baek Yoonho had asked if she needed some rest out of concern, but the woman insisted that they complete the investigation .  She explained that she was relatively comfortable(?) in there . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>The two upper management members who conducted the interview, Guildmaster Baek Yoonho and Chief Ahn Sangmin, were at a loss for words .  The one who was in charge of the training, Hyun Gicheol, was sent to the Association to argue about the incident . As such, only three people were gathered in the meeting room .  Ahn Sangmin broke the silence,</p>
<p>“Was all that really true?”</p>
<p>“You can contact Go Myunghwan and Yoon Gijoong . They’ll tell you the same story . ”</p>
<p>The two C-rankers had returned to their homes, stating that they wanted to see their families .  Park Heejin could confidently say that their statements would not differ from hers . </p>
<p>‘All I did was explain what I experienced in person . ’</p>
<p>How the forest that man disappeared off to rang with screams of ice bears, or how that man was doing push-ups while everyone else was sleeping .  She didn’t dare to include any hearsay from the other teammates, only what she had seen with her own two eyes . </p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin made a strange noise with his mouth .  Knocking out an A-rank Hunter in one hit . Freely using spatial magic .  Wielding dozens of summons . Each one of them alone would be an unbelievable thing .  And the man in question had done it all . But the most shocking fact was,</p>
<p>“So he solo cleared a high-level Dungeon . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho uttered after a long period of silence .  It was because he was an S-ranker that he was able to say,</p>
<p>“That is an incredible feat . ”</p>
<p>Although the man had fought with summons, those summons were not comrades but Hunter Sung Jinwoo’s skill .  It was the same as solo clearing the Dungeon . </p>
<p>“No matter how high one’s rank is, it is difficult for a Hunter to solo clear a high-level Dungeon . ”</p>
<p>A Red Gate on top of that . </p>
<p>What if he himself was there? Could he solo clear a B-rank Red Gate? It was possible for Hunter Sung Jinwoo, who wielded not one or two but dozens of summons .  Ahn Sangmin spoke with amazement,</p>
<p>“With this, it is clear that he’s an Awakened Being with special powers . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho agreed,</p>
<p>“Among Hunters, those that can use summoning are rare .  And to think that he’s a Hunter that can wield multiple summons…”</p>
<p>Having worked as an S-rank Hunter, Baek Yoonho had met and conversed with many different Hunters .  Not one of them ever spoke of a Hunter wielding that many summons . </p>
<p>“An Awakened Being with a special power in a different dimension than the average special power…”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho was amazed .  Ahn Sangmin thought of something and asked,</p>
<p>“If you had to put a value on Sung Jinwoo-ssi’s abilities, how much do you think he’s worth right now?”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho could not easily reply .  But one thing was for sure, regardless of what the value of Sung Jinwoo was right now, it would multiply explosively once the man underwent the retest .  They had to act before that happened . Baekho had just lost an A-rank Hunter and multiple B-rank Hunters . If they were not able to obtain the power known as Sung Jinwoo, their losses from this incident would be too great . </p>
<p>“I trust you, Chief Ahn . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho sent a look of faith towards the man .  Ahn Sangmin replied with a determined expression . Suddenly, the two men turned toward Park Heejin .  The woman was raising a hand . </p>
<p>“Do you have something to ask?”</p>
<p>Succeeding in grabbing the two men’s attentions, Park Heejin lowered her hand,</p>
<p>“Please allow me to help . ”</p>
<p>“With what?”</p>
<p>“Raid Lead- I mean, Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim’s recruitment . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho and Ahn Sangmin exchanged glances .  The Recruitment Specialist Ahn Sangmin tilted his head,</p>
<p>“Why would Hunter Park Heejin-nim be…?”</p>
<p>“Of the members of our Guild, I’m the one who spent the most time with Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim . I believe I can be of great assistance . ”</p>
<p>6 hours outside of the Gate .  Nearly a week inside . Baek Yoonho and Ahn Sangmin thought Park Heejin’s words made sense .  On top of that, the woman was a beauty . Her appearance wouldn't exactly be a hindrance in their efforts to obtain Sung Jinwoo .  Realizing her suggestion was moving the minds of the Guildmaster and the chief, Park Heejin continued,</p>
<p>“But I have one condition . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho asked,</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Once Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim enters Baekho, please be sure to place me in his raiding party . ”</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:. [1]: “Baruka’s Tanto”: Tanto was covered before; it is a word for a japanese dagger/knife .  Baruka (바루카): “ba” + “ru” + “ka” . Translating the “r” or “l” sound from east asian languages often is shortened to remove the vowel sound, but in this case, I kept the “ru” as it was .  If it was “르” (reu) instead of “루” (roo), I might’ve shortened it to Balka . </p>
<p>[2]: “missus” (형수님): I chose not to do the usual and put this in korean .  I don’t think it’s a word that’ll come up that much throughout the story . The korean word here means “wife of older brother” .  More commonly used in actual blood relative situations, but jokingly/friendly used by non-related people as well to their hyung’s wife/girlfriend .  </p>
<p>[3]: What the fuck . </p>
