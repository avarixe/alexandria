<h3>Chapter 150: Chapter 150</h3> 
<p>A certain man was sneaking into a large hospital </p>
<p>There was only one reason why he was making d*mn sure that no one saw him . And that would be because of the jerry can full of petrol he was carrying at the moment </p>
<p>In the past, one couldn't find any sort of desire or drive within this man's eyes . But now, they were burning with vigour </p>
<p>'So, you dare to look down on me, huh?'. </p>
<p>He was already resolved to die today </p>
<p>This man wandered about silently for a long while, before finally choosing a suitable location . His steps came to a halt in one of the hospital's many corridors, although this particular one didn't seem to enjoy all that much foot traffic . He began cautiously pouring the petrol on the floor </p>
<p>'You think I'll die all alone?'. </p>
<p>It happened one week ago </p>
<p>He got p*ss drunk and wandered around the streets, before picking a fight with some random passerby . And as a result, he got beaten up black and blue . So, he ended up in this hospital </p>
<p>He regained his consciousness a bit later and declared to the doctor busy treating him . He said, 'I don't have enough money for the hospital fees, so might as well stop what you're doing and let me go' </p>
<p>It happened then </p>
<p>He saw it </p>
<p>He saw the doctor's eyes, looking down on him as if he was a pathetic fool </p>
<p>That d*mn doctor b*stard . This man couldn't quite remember the face of that doctor, but even after all this time, he could never forget those eyes </p>
<p>That's why he made up his mind </p>
<p>'I'll get my revenge on you . '. </p>
<p>And that was his reason for seeking out the very hospital he once visited as its guest </p>
<p>He wasn't planning to live any longer, anyway . So, he poured the petrol all over this corner of the hospital, and then, dumped what little remained on himself </p>
<p>"We'll all go together . ". </p>
<p>His voice was thickly laden with spiteful rage </p>
<p>Of course, this hospital was pretty d*mn huge, so something like this wouldn't even be able to burn it down completely . However, he should still be able to take a few with him . It'd be very good if a handful of doctors were included in that 'few', but if not, there's not much he could do about that </p>
<p>He already ruined his life through gambling anyway . But, he wasn't planning to quietly disappear like everyone else </p>
<p>He threw away the empty jerry can, and after rummaging through his pockets for a while, pulled out a lighter . The moment his thumb spins that flint, this f*cked-up life of his would come to an end </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>He became expressionless and was about to press down with his thumb, but then, an eerie breeze suddenly brushed him by </p>
<p>'… . There's a breeze?'. </p>
<p>The man felt something was off and scanned his vicinity . This corridor didn't even have any windows, so where could have that breeze come from?. </p>
<p>'What was that?'. </p>
<p>He tilted his head while looking around himself, only to abruptly realise that something felt rather empty down there . He lowered his gaze to his hand </p>
<p>The lighter he held in his hand was gone </p>
<p>'… . !!'. </p>
<p>What an incredibly puzzling thing that was </p>
<p>He wondered if he dropped the lighter while he was preoccupied, so he carefully combed over the floor, but that turned out to be a waste of time </p>
<p>'Just where did it disappear to ?'. </p>
<p>Feeling utterly puzzled now, he raised his head and then spotted a large, black something standing right in front of his eyes </p>
<p>It was an 'insect' with hands and legs </p>
<p>The man was greatly taken by surprise, his eyes bulging out until they were almost popping out . Before he could scream, though, the 'insect' reached out and grabbed his mouth </p>
<p>"Euph!!". </p>
<p>"Kiikiik . ". </p>
<p>The 'insect' raised the index finger of its free hand and pressed it against its mouth </p>
<p>"Shush . ". </p>
<p>This human shouldn't raise a commotion like this . The human female his king told him to protect was sleeping in a room nearby, after all </p>
<p>The man struggled bitterly, but he couldn't even budge a single finger of the monster off his face </p>
<p>"Euph, eupphhh!!". </p>
<p>The man's eyes now saw the 'insect' – no, Beru's open mouth slowly growing closer towards him </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Why did 'it' happen on level 101?. </p>
<p>As Jin-Woo drove back, he thought back to how his skills abruptly went up a level earlier in the day . Even though his mind was occupied with something else, his hands holding the steering wheel remained steady and controlled </p>
<p>'It's not even level 100, too . '. </p>
<p>He thought that, if something about him were to change because of the level ups, then that should happen on level 100 . However, his expectation was a bit off the mark </p>
<p>His Class-specific skills all got an upgrade after he reached level 101 </p>
<p>A few guesses fleeted in and out of his head, but currently, only two of them held the strongest possibilities of being right </p>
<p>The first one was about what the number '1' signified . '1' meant a new beginning </p>
<p>Could it be that, when his level reached 101, all restrictions on his Class-specific skills were removed and he was now free to upgrade them at will?. </p>
<p>'If that's not it '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's expression hardened when he thought about the second theory . Personally, he'd have much preferred for this one to be wrong, though </p>
<p>'Could it be because I got my Class at level 51 . ?'. </p>
<p>There was a possibility that the Skill levels rose up because he was exactly 50 levels higher than when he got his Class . Which also kind of implied that he needed to reach level 151 if he wanted to upgrade his Skills again </p>
<p>'… I don't want that . '. </p>
<p>If he thought about his levelling up speed lately, then indeed, he could only dearly pray that this remained nothing more than his hypothesis </p>
<p>Soon, the building with his Guild office came into his view . Jin-Woo drove the van into the underground parking lot . He was the only passenger riding on the trusty steed of the Ah-Jin Guild, 'Bonggo' . Yu Jin-Ho chose to stay back in the Gate's location, saying that he'd wrap up the proceedings before going back to the office </p>
<p>The raid might have ended, but there was still one more step of handing over the recovered loot to the brokers to think about . Since it was Yu Jin-Ho who had contacted these brokers, it seemed that he wanted to personally take charge of handling this matter </p>
<p>["Please, leave everything to me, hyung-nim!"]. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo thought that he could still hear Yu Jin-Ho's voice filled with confidence even now </p>
<p>'I wonder, will he be okay?'. </p>
<p>It was all good and well for a Vice-Chair of the Guild to be full of drive and energy, but wouldn't it be better still to hire dedicated staff members for matters like this? Jin-Woo told himself to search for more employees and walked out of the underground parking lot </p>
<p>But then . </p>
<p>'Mm?'. </p>
<p>He spotted a familiar figure walking towards the Guild building from afar . And that familiar person also discovered Jin-Woo staring back at her </p>
<p>"Ah ". </p>
<p>Her steps came to an abrupt halt right then and there </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In formed a shocked expression and began to backtrack one step at a time before she turned around completely, and began running away </p>
<p>' . HUH??'. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was utterly dumbstruck by what just happened </p>
<p>The thing was, though – he could gloss over the reason why she suddenly started running away after seeing his face, but he simply couldn't . </p>
<p>'… . You think you can escape from me because you started running?'. </p>
<p>Just who did she think she was dealing with here?. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was suddenly overcome with a streak of stubbornness and pounced forward with everything he had after activating his 'Quicksilver' skill </p>
<p>Time slowed down to a crawl, and only the background images seemed to move at a blinding pace . The distance between him and Cha Hae-In decreased quickly enough, and then he began thinking to himself </p>
<p>'If I grab her from the back or try to touch her, she might get hurt, so '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo lightly jumped up in the air, spun around once, and landed in front of Cha Hae-In's escaping figure </p>
<p>'… . !!'. </p>
<p>Her eyes grew super wide in an instant </p>
<p>Her escape route had been cut off, and before she could do anything else, her shoulders were caught by Jin-Woo's hands </p>
<p>"Kyahk!". </p>
<p>And so, the foot chase between two rank S Hunters came to a very anti-climatic end . Now that she was caught by him, she couldn't even bring herself to look into his eyes </p>
<p>Jin-Woo continued to stare at her with deeply puzzled eyes, before calmly asking her the important question </p>
<p>"Why did you run away after seeing me?". </p>
<p>" . ". </p>
<p>Well, he could concede a bit here and say that it was possible for her to bolt like that . Fine </p>
<p>"If you were going to run, then why did you even bother to come to my office?". </p>
<p>If she wanted to avoid him that much, then she shouldn't even come anywhere near him, no? Jin-Woo's pointed question elicited Cha Hae-In to reply in a voice that was smaller than a buzzing mosquito </p>
<p>"My car is . still in your parking lot ". </p>
<p>'Ah . Right . There was an unfamiliar car parked in the lot for the last couple of days, wasn't there?'. </p>
<p>That day, when Cha Hae-In came to the office, saying that she wanted to join his Guild . </p>
<p>After they 'teleported' directly to the Association's gymnasium from the Guild office, she forgot to take her car back and left it in the underground parking lot until now </p>
<p>'Looks like she came sneaking back in to get her car back because our Guild was supposed to be on a raid today . '. </p>
<p>Too bad for her, she couldn't have imagined that he'd only need a little over two hours to complete the raid of a rank A Gate . As a result, these two young people got to meet each other again . She quickly tried to get away from him, but in the end, was apprehended by him instead </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's wordless stare continued, and Cha Hae-In's head drooped lower and lower . He let out a helpless sigh and slowly let her shoulders go </p>
<p>"There's no need to run away from me, you know . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo spoke as he formed an amiable smile </p>
<p>"A person's mind can change all the time, am I right?". </p>
<p>Indeed, wouldn't people lose their interest, or suddenly gain interest when there was none, to begin with? Wasn't that how a person's heart operated? There was no reason for them to go out of their way to avoid each other like this </p>
<p>" . ". </p>
<p>However, Cha Hae-In didn't even try to refute him, her head still remaining lowered </p>
<p>'Maybe, she doesn't even feel like talking to me?'. </p>
<p>It was possible that she was unhappy about suddenly being grabbed like that </p>
<p>"Well, then . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo turned around to leave with a little nod as his goodbye . No, he was going to turn around . But before he could, Cha Hae-In hurriedly held on to his sleeve </p>
<p>"Excuse me . ". </p>
<p>" ?". </p>
<p>By the time four, five question marks floated over Jin-Woo's head, she finally stopped hesitating and opened her lips to speak </p>
<p>"Can you free up some time so we can talk for a little while?". </p>
<p>Only a minute ago she was fleeing for her dear life, but now, she wanted to speak to him?. </p>
<p>Perhaps she sensed Jin-Woo's flustered confusion, Cha Hae-In quickly explained herself </p>
<p>"Actually, Min Byung-Gu Hunter-nim wanted me to pass on a message to you . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's expression changed once he heard that unexpected name come out of her mouth </p>
<p>"A message for me?". </p>
<p>Nod, nod </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In's head bobbed up and down </p>
<p>"He said, there was something he wanted to say about your powers, Seong Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>But, how could that be? Jin-Woo didn't have any point of contact, private or otherwise, with Hunter Min Byung-Gu . And their one and only meeting came around when Jin-Woo revived Min Byung-Gu into a Shadow Soldier for a short while back then </p>
<p>The deceased Hunter carried out his job perfectly and thanks to that, Cha Hae-In was able to survive . It was all due to that man's efforts that these two young people could talk to each other like this </p>
<p>But then, just when did he have the time to leave a message behind?. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn't display his power until the Jeju raid, and when he did, Min Byung-Gu was already long dead </p>
<p>Something like that couldn't have happened </p>
<p>Jin-Woo stared at her with a disbelieving expression . Cha Hae-In cautiously continued on </p>
<p>"Your power, Seong Hunter-nim ". </p>
<p>But, when her words reached there, Jin-Woo quickly cut her off </p>
<p>"Hold on, please . ". </p>
<p>Didn't matter if what she wanted to say was true or not, this topic didn't seem well suited to be discussed in the middle of the street </p>
<p>Jin-Woo scanned his vicinity once, and then continued to speak to her </p>
<p>"Let's continue our discussion somewhere more private, shall we?". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Chairman Yu Myung-Han received the files containing certain information from his Secretary Kim </p>
<p>"These are?". </p>
<p>"They are information gathered from Seoul Il-Sin hospital, sir . ". </p>
<p>Il-Sin hospital was where Hunter Seong Jin-Woo's mother had been staying until recently . Yu Myung-Han's eyes sharpened instantly . Without saying anything else, he began reading the documents </p>
<p>'The nurse entered in the morning and she was already wide awake? And Hunter Seong Jin-Woo was found right next to his mother?'. </p>
<p>There was another strange thing mentioned in the file </p>
<p>The hospital staff recommended an in-depth analysis of the patient's conditions to be carried out as they were concerned about her health, but Hunter Seong strongly demanded for her release, instead </p>
<p>Chairman Yu Myung-Han unconsciously shook his head </p>
<p>'That doesn't sound like him '. </p>
<p>That man possessed such a strong filial love that he risked his life and limb by entering dangerous raids in order to earn enough money for her hospital fees . However, such a man one-sidedly demanded his mother's release, when he couldn't have been sure of her physical condition?. </p>
<p>'No, it's the exact opposite . '. </p>
<p>This could only mean that Hunter Seong Jin-Woo had already confirmed his mother's status by then </p>
<p>But, how did he do that?. </p>
<p>The longer Yu Myung-Han read the data sent in from the hospital, the deeper the frowns on his forehead became </p>
<p>Everything about Hunter Seong Jin-Woo was shrouded in mystery </p>
<p>'The dual dungeon incident, his sudden Re-Awakening, his mother's abrupt recovery, and even his mysterious ability to create countless summoned creatures . '. </p>
<p>Wouldn't a series of serendipities eventually become inevitability?. </p>
<p>There was definitely something here . There was absolutely no doubt about that . Yu Myung-Han's sharply-honed senses were telling him such . His resolution became even firmer than before </p>
<p>"Looks like I'll have to talk to him face to face . ". </p>
<p>"I shall send over someone before the end of today, sir . ". </p>
<p>"No need for that . ". </p>
<p>Secretary Kim was taken aback from that reply </p>
<p>"Sir, are you planning to go see him personally?". </p>
<p>"Secretary Kim . Who do you think the man I'm trying to meet is?". </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>That was enough to shut Secretary Kim's mouth </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>Vrrrr . </p>
<p>Secretary Kim's phone suddenly began vibrating . Chairman Yu Myung-Han returned his gaze back to the files and gave his permission </p>
<p>"It's fine to answer it . ". </p>
<p>Secretary Kim bowed his head slightly and quickly checked his phone . It was a text message carrying urgent breaking news </p>
<p>"Chairman, sir . ". </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Han raised his head again </p>
<p>"There's breaking news coming from Japan as we speak . Would you like to see it, sir?". </p>
<p>Secretary Kim wasn't someone to get easily agitated over a simple matter . If he was asking you about whether you wanted to see something or not, then that was the same thing as you needing to see that something immediately </p>
<p>Nod </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Han nodded his head, and as if he was waiting for that, Secretary Kim quickly switched on the giant TV hanging on the wall </p>
<p>- Yes, this is foreign correspondent Park Seong-Woo reporting . As you can see behind me </p>
<p>The real-time live broadcast of Japan's most bustling downtown area filled up the TV screen as the device flickered into life </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Shinjuku, located in Tokyo, Japan </p>
<p>A gloomy shadow was being cast on the busiest, liveliest avenue in Tokyo, the one often referred to as the beating heart of Japan . That wasn't a simple figure of speech, though </p>
<p>Every single car, bicycle, and person – didn't matter who or what, they were all standing still beneath this massive shade cast over them </p>
<p>People began climbing out from their stopped vehicles one by one . The road was becoming uncontrollably clogged up, but not one honked their horns or yelled out in irritation </p>
<p>It was as if everyone here had been bewitched by an unseen force </p>
<p>Every single gaze was directed to one particular spot </p>
<p>"Oh, my god . ". </p>
<p>"Dear Lord ". </p>
<p>There was a Gate so huge that it blocked out the sky to cast an enormous shade onto the ground below </p>
<p>The people below saw this common-sense-shattering Gate that easily matched a regular skyscraper in sheer size, and fell deep into the state of indescribable shock </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>" . ". </p>
<p>The avenue once bustling with overflowing people was now being gripped tighter and tighter by a silence so wretched that it almost induced some of the witnesses to start vomiting </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The atmosphere in the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence was rather poor, as well </p>
<p>Slam!. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister couldn't hold back his rising tide of anger and threw the remote control hard at the TV busy showing the breaking news </p>
<p>"P-Prime Minister!". </p>
<p>His adjutants hurriedly got up, but they shut their mouths and sat back down once the Prime Minister's dagger-like eyes landed on them </p>
<p>"Why isn't the Hunter's Association saying anything?". </p>
<p>The President of the Japanese Hunter's Association, Matsumoto Shigeo, weakly lowered his head . He had become a lot more haggard ever since returning from his trip to South Korea </p>
<p>The Prime Minister's expression hardened </p>
<p>"God d*mn it ". </p>
<p>Something that horrifying had appeared in the middle of Tokyo, yet the Association who should be in charge of such things, were keeping their mouths shut?!. </p>
<p>"A rank S Gate has appeared right in the heart of Tokyo! But, do you think it makes any sort of sense for the Association to not have a single countermeasure in place? How??". </p>
<p>The Prime Minister cried out in anguish </p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, everyone present kept their mouths shut as if they had agreed to do so beforehand . The Prime Minister's expression crumpled unsightly, like a man carrying the weight of all the suffering found in this world, before he collapsed down onto his chair </p>
<p>"Be honest with me, Association President . ". </p>
<p>He then pointed at the cracked TV screen </p>
<p>"What will happen if that thing opens up on us?". </p>
<p>" . It'll be the end, sir . ". </p>
<p>As he thought – the Prime Minister hugged his head and muttered out helplessly </p>
<p>"So, that's how it is . Just one Gate, and the city of Tokyo is finished, is that it?". </p>
<p>"That's not what I'm saying, Prime Minister . ". </p>
<p>" ?". </p>
<p>The Prime Minister raised his head to look, and Association President Matsumoto Shigeo continued on with an emotionless voice </p>
<p>"I meant to say that the entirety of Japan will be finished, sir . ". </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 150 &gt; Fin </p>
