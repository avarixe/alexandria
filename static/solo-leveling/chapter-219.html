<h3>Chapter 219: Chapter 219</h3> <p>The words of ‘I am you’ </p>
<p>Since he had been exposed to the Black Heart, Jin-Woo could understand the meaning behind those words </p>
<p>He looked to his right </p>
<p>Suddenly, a massive tree the size of several dozen skyscrapers bound together rose up to pierce the heavens above </p>
<p>He looked to the other side next </p>
<p>When his head turned to the left, a maglev train suddenly emerged from the distant darkness and shot past his position in the blink of an eye . These two appeared out of nowhere simply because Jin-Woo wished to see them </p>
<p>In other words, something was created from nothing </p>
<p>[That’s right . ]. </p>
<p>The Shadow Sovereign addressed him </p>
<p>[Within my territory, you can do anything you want . ]. </p>
<p>“Because you and I possess the same power?”. </p>
<p>The Shadow Sovereign nodded his head . His gaze shifted over to the giant tree Jin-Woo created . In an instant, the tree’s size decreased and changed to a single little flower commonly seen everywhere </p>
<p>Although this power to create and change worlds was limited to the Shadow Sovereign’s territory, Jin-Woo still ended up letting out a sigh of admiration </p>
<p>This omnipotent power had become his now . Jin-Woo briefly closed his eyes before opening them up, and that prompted a field of flowers to bloom before his feet and spread out in all directions </p>
<p>It was the same type of flower as the one the Shadow Sovereign created by changing the tree </p>
<p>Was this the result of the excellent Perception, or because he was connected to the Shadow Sovereign? Jin-Woo could sense the Sovereign feeling satisfied while looking at the field of flowers </p>
<p>The Sovereign shifted his gaze over to his human counterpart </p>
<p>[I have been looking forward to this moment, this meeting with you, for a very long time . ]. </p>
<p>The Shadow Sovereign officially introduced himself </p>
<p>[I am the Shadow Sovereign . I am the King of the Dead, ruler of death’s power, and an administrator of the deepest part of the darkness . ]. </p>
<p>Awesome, dignified presence oozed out from the Sovereign . However, Jin-Woo didn’t feel scared even though true death capable of reducing any living being into a shuddering mess was right before him </p>
<p>This being was him . He felt his emotions soar higher after meeting another version of himself </p>
<p>Finally </p>
<p>Finally, he could ask that one question stuck in his head, not wanting to let him go ever since the System became a part of his life </p>
<p>“Why… . was I chosen?”. </p>
<p>Why did the System choose him as the ‘Player’? Was it because he managed to survive the dual dungeon that day?. </p>
<p>No, it couldn’t have been . He believed that there had to be another reason . And this was the moment that his question might get an answer </p>
<p>[I shall show you . ]. </p>
<p>The Shadow Sovereign slowly extended his hand towards Jin-Woo’s forehead . The moment that forefinger touched him, the entire world changed </p>
<p>[This is our beginning and the end . And also, your beginning . ]. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Would there ever have been a moment in history that so many people in so many countries screamed out at the same time?. </p>
<p>In that cruel moment when the monster’s dagger penetrated Hunter Seong Jin-Woo’s chest, people held their heads or screamed their lungs out . What came to visit them after the screaming was silence as heavy as blocks of steel </p>
<p>Grief-stricken gasps escaped from the lips of everyone watching Hunter Seong Jin-Woo powerlessly crumble to the ground </p>
<p>“Ah…”. </p>
<p>First, it was the Special Authority-rank Hunter, Thomas Andre . And now, even Seong Jin-Woo had fallen </p>
<p>If so, who else was left?. </p>
<p>There was no one </p>
<p>Knowing full well that there was no one else left to stop these monsters, the expressions of people began hardening like stone </p>
<p>And then, a short while later </p>
<p>– Uh? Wha-what’s going on here? Uh? Uhhh??. </p>
<p>Shortly after the cameraman cried out in panic, even the transmission got cut off </p>
<p>The super-massive Gate floating above the skies of Seoul, and then, the monsters that appeared out of nowhere to continuously murder the top-ranked Hunters in the world . The viewers around the world couldn’t erase the thoughts of ‘Are we seeing the advent of the world’s end?’ out of their minds </p>
<p>In the midst of all the shock and panic, people couldn’t move away from the front of their screens even though the transmission had been cut off for a long time now </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The filming helicopter, now frozen solid and smoke pouring out from the side, crashed back to earth . The Sovereign of Frost withdrew its hand, having successfully destroyed the annoying flying contraption </p>
<p>Its gaze shifted over to Jin-Woo next . The creature’s ice-covered lips bobbed up and down to announce Jin-Woo’s status </p>
<p>[His life has come to an end . ]. </p>
<p>The eyes and the ears of the Sovereign of Beastly Fangs confirmed the death of his prey . It could not sense any hint of life from the subject at all </p>
<p>They managed to succeed in stopping one of the most powerful kings from turning into an unwelcome variable in their plan . Their eyes were now swimming in the ecstasy of victory </p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the end of their work . Not yet </p>
<p>The two Sovereigns raised their heads and their glares simultaneously locked onto Thomas Andre, currently evacuated a good distance away </p>
<p>Lennart Niermann flinched nastily after sensing their gaze </p>
<p>“D*mn it… . ”. </p>
<p>He had to prepare himself to lose his life just from trying to fend off one beast-like humanoid creature, but now, there was an Ice Elf on a similar level as the beast to contend with, too… </p>
<p>‘How did Hunter Seong Jin-Woo manage to fight against them… . ?’. </p>
<p>His heart rate got faster and faster . The thing was, he was the only Hunter capable of buying even a second of time against those two monsters </p>
<p>Lennart took a deep breath </p>
<p>“Hey, man… . Hunter Seong’s presence vanished just now . Can’t you tell me what’s going on?”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre, his wounds not even half-healed yet, threw out a question </p>
<p>Lennart forced his unwilling lips to part </p>
<p>“He’s… . ”. </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>The two Sovereigns walking leisurely over in Lennart’s direction simultaneously looked behind them </p>
<p>[… !!]. </p>
<p>[… !!]. </p>
<p>Something impossible happened, just then . From the body of the human whose heart was confirmed to be destroyed, they could hear vigorous, pounding heartbeats </p>
<p>But, how?. </p>
<p>How could such a thing be possible?. </p>
<p>The two Sovereigns exchanged disbelieving gazes with each other . And then, the absolute worst possibility entered their heads next . They had been overlooking this crucial fact until now </p>
<p>[Can it be… . ?]. </p>
<p>These two thought that, by killing the human host, they would also get to extinguish the Shadow Sovereign within, too . Just like how they themselves would die after taking over their hosts </p>
<p>However, their opponent this time was the King of the Dead . There was no guarantee that death, supposed to treat everyone equally regardless of who, would be applied to him in the same manner </p>
<p>The end of one could also become the beginning for someone else </p>
<p>[No…! We can’t let this happen!!]. </p>
<p>They had to stop this at all costs </p>
<p>They had to stop the descent of the true king via this fake death </p>
<p>Their expression turned utterly pale before they reacted almost instinctively . Two Sovereigns instantly closed the distance to Jin-Woo and reached out with their long claws and ice spear </p>
<p>In order to completely destroy the body that’d act as the tool of the King’s descent, they poured in their entire magical energy into their weapons </p>
<p>Unfortunately… </p>
<p>A figure hidden in ‘Stealth’ lightly landed on the ground before them and his shortswords blocked the claws and the ice spear quite ably </p>
<p>The Shadow Sovereign hadn’t regained his consciousness yet . In that case, who could this being be?. </p>
<p>[… ??]. </p>
<p>The two Sovereigns couldn’t hide their shock and fluster after their desperate attacks were defended against </p>
<p>The owner of the shortswords undid his Stealth and finally revealed himself . It was a figure cloaked in a hood . A pair of eyes gleaming in pure golden light were glaring at the Sovereigns from below the hood </p>
<p>“From here on, none shall touch this child . ”. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>In another world </p>
<p>Light and darkness existed in an age where nothing else yet existed </p>
<p>The Absolute Being split the light and created the Emissaries of God . As for the darkness, it was split to create eight Sovereigns </p>
<p>Heeding the command issued during their birth, the Sovereigns born to destroy worlds and the Emissaries born to maintain the worlds began killing each other’s soldiers over and over again </p>
<p>At the end of the lengthy war </p>
<p>Fatigued by the constant and unending war, the most bright Fragment of the Brilliant Light asked the Absolute Being </p>
<p>‘Oh, our Absolute Ruler </p>
<p>Why does thee not aid thy most faithful subjects fighting in thy honour?. </p>
<p>Why does thee ignore thy subjects’ pain?. </p>
<p>Doth thee really not hear the screams of countless soldiers dying for thy honour?. </p>
<p>Aid us </p>
<p>Lend us the strength to extinguish our opponents . We shall cut off their heads and offer them as the tribute to thy glory . ’. </p>
<p>However, the Absolute Being didn’t reply back to the Fragment </p>
<p>It was at that moment the Fragments came to a realisation . And that would be the truth of the battle between themselves and the Sovereigns being nothing more than a form of entertainment to the Absolute Being . And that their Ruler didn’t wish for the battles to end </p>
<p>Now knowing that the war would never end as long as the Absolute Being continued to exist, the Fragments fell into despair . The despair they felt transformed into rage, and rage soon morphed into hatred </p>
<p>To end this meaningless war, they unsheathed their blades </p>
<p>It was the start of the rebellion </p>
<p>Jin-Woo witnessed the endless march of the soldiers spanning the cosmos itself </p>
<p>“Oh, my god… . ”. </p>
<p>However, a group of soldiers suddenly appeared from the distance and blocked the march . The Shadow Sovereign next to Jin-Woo pointed at the Fragment of the Brilliant Light with six wings, standing in front of the blocking group </p>
<p>[That was the me of the distant past . ]. </p>
<p>He was the sole Emissary of God who stood up against the rebellion of the other Emissaries . In the end, though, the pitiful number of soldiers he led powerlessly fell before the united armies of the Emissaries </p>
<p>The Fragment of the Brilliant Light never lost his absolute loyalty until the end . He died watching his brave subordinates get swept away by their enemies </p>
<p>He thought that this was the end </p>
<p>But when he reopened his eyes within the embrace of the darkness, he came to realise that the Absolute Being had hidden a certain power inside of him </p>
<p>For that eventuality when everything went wrong, the Absolute Being had hidden a truly fiendish power capable of ending everything, inside its most loyal slave </p>
<p>And so, floating within this endless abyss of darkness, the Sovereign of Death had finally opened his eyes towards his power . He tore off the remaining traces of his wings, all burnt away from the battle, and crafted brand new armour out of the surrounding darkness </p>
<p>[ARISE-!!]. </p>
<p>Souls sleeping within this abyss heard the call and swore eternal allegiance to their new king </p>
<p>He led his brand new army and made his return . But when he finally came back, everything was already over </p>
<p>The remaining Fragments of Brilliant Light had killed the Absolute Being and called themselves the new gods, thus assuming the position of the ‘Rulers’ . And using various tools containing the might of the Absolute Being, they hunted down the Sovereigns </p>
<p>When the King of Giants, the Sovereign of the Beginning, Reghia, was captured, the balance between the two sides collapsed and the remaining Sovereigns realised the severity of the situation </p>
<p>It was at that moment that the Shadow Sovereign extended his hands to them . To combat their common enemy, every existing Sovereign combined their forces </p>
<p>And in this manner, the war between seven ‘Rulers’ and nine ‘Sovereigns’ continued on, forever </p>
<p>The longer this war continued on, however, the greater the army of the Shadow Sovereign grew . Time was on his side </p>
<p>Thanks to his brilliant achievements, it seemed as if the victors of this long, long war would be the Sovereigns </p>
<p>However, it wasn’t only the Rulers fearing the might of the Shadow Army that had grown, unbeknownst to all, to equal the Army of Destruction led by the King of Berserk Dragons </p>
<p>Two Sovereigns feared the Shadow Sovereign . The Two of them were the Sovereign of White Flames and the Sovereign of Beastly Fangs . They aimed for the back of the former Emissary just as the war was drawing to a close </p>
<p>It was at this point that Jin-Woo got to witness again the scenes he saw within the ‘saved data’ back in the dual dungeon . The armies of demons and beasts joined hands with the armies of the Rulers and pounced on the Shadow Sovereign and his army </p>
<p>And that resulted in him being driven to near-annihilation </p>
<p>But then, the King of Beasts, the Sovereign of Beastly Fangs ran away to save its own life, while forsaking its own soldiers . Meanwhile, the King of Demons, the Sovereign of White Flames, Baran, had to pay the ultimate price </p>
<p>The words Jin-Woo couldn’t understand; when he heard the words of the dying Baran, his eyes shook around really hard back then </p>
<p>And then, above his head – four angels with six wings slowly descended from the sky . That was where the video playback of the ‘data’ Jin-Woo watched came to an end </p>
<p>The four Rulers soon surrounded the Shadow Sovereign, who no longer possessed enough strength to command his own Shadow Army . The Sovereign must’ve figured out what the inevitable result of this fight would be and discarded his sword to the ground </p>
<p>But, if those Rulers had killed the Shadow Sovereign back then, how could the existence of this Shadow Sovereign even be explained?. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo swallowed his dry saliva and paid even closer attention, to what could possibly be the end of the Shadow Sovereign </p>
<p>But then… </p>
<p>The Rulers began kneeling before the Shadow Sovereign one by one . And a short while later, the six-winged angel kneeling in front raised his voice </p>
<p>[Please, it’s time that you forgive us, oh, greatest Fragment of Brilliant Light . ]. </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 219 &gt; Fin </p>
