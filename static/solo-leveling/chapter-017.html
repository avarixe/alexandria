<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 17</p>
<p>As she was shaking her head in disbelief, Jinwoo suddenly came back out and held an umbrella towards her . </p>
<p>“Why an umbrella?”</p>
<p>She took the umbrella and looked up to the sky .  It was still dark at dawn, but the sky appeared to be clear . </p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s going to rain today . ”</p>
<p>“Just take it . ”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a hassle…”</p>
<p>“Just take it still .  It’s not that heavy, stop crying . ”</p>
<p>He closed the door and went back inside .  </p>
<p>“Sigh- always so stubborn . ”</p>
<p>She tapped the door rebelliously with her foot few times, then put the umbrella in her bag and started walking . </p>
<p>‘Wait…’</p>
<p>She recalled her brother’s figure just now .  It was strange . Her brother was distinctly taller than she had remembered . </p>
<p>“Do men still keep growing after 20?”</p>
<p>‘Can’t be…’</p>
<p>She shook her head again and walked towards school . </p>
<p>click</p>
<p>Jinwoo locked the door and opened his inventory . </p>
<p>“Storage . ”</p>
<p>Storage .  Inv . Inventory . </p>
<p>After experimenting, he found that the spoken command did not have to be that exact .  Same with the messages . Various phrases with the intent and meaning of “opening” worked .  </p>
<p>He took the umbrella obtained from today’s Random Box and put it into the digital storage before his eyes . </p>
<p>“Today’s was a bust again . ”</p>
<p>It had been four days since his first trip into an Instant Dungeon .  Since then, he had hoped for another key from the Random Boxes but was not so lucky . </p>
<p>‘How disappointing . ’</p>
<p>He went to his room and sat on his bed . </p>
<p>There was something he had to decide today . </p>
<p>“Stat . ”</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 48</p>
<p>Constitution: 27</p>
<p>Agility: 27</p>
<p>Intelligence: 27</p>
<p><strong>Sense: 27</strong>.   </p>
<p>(Available stat points: 12)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Four days’ worth of stat points were piled up in his stat screen .  He had not missed a single daily quest, and of course, diligently collected the rewards .  But he had not used any of the points yet . He wasn’t sure what to do with them . </p>
<p>“ . This is hard . ”</p>
<p>Indeed it was .  It was not an easy decision to make . </p>
<p></p>
<p>Strength .  Good stat . No regrets in dumping every point in it so far . </p>
<p>Agility .  Also good stat .  Not needed against low level enemies, but absolutely critical against stronger foes .  Speed was relative, after all . </p>
<p>Constitution and sense .  Having higher health was always a good thing, and sense turned out to be surprisingly useful as well . </p>
<p>Intelligence…</p>
<p> . This was the problem .  This was the sole attribute that he had no information to go on .  Even after his levels rose, he didn’t really feel smarter . His memorization didn’t exactly improve, nor did his mental math become any faster . </p>
<p>‘I’m sure it’s related to magic…’</p>
<p>Perhaps he didn’t need it after all . </p>
<p>That left just strength, agility, constitution and sense . </p>
<p>“ . Still, it’s hard . ”</p>
<p>Even with one less choice, he still was not sure .  The synergy between strength and agility was clear; no matter how hard he could hit, it meant nothing if he couldn’t hit his target .  On the same hand, no matter how accurate he was, it meant nothing without power behind the attack . With that in mind, strength and agility were a set . </p>
<p>‘Since my strength is at a good place, I should bring up agility to a similar level . ’</p>
<p>At the same time, if he chose to raise the agility stat, he would have to put a lower priority on constitution .  The synergy between agility and constitution was bad . With high agility, his ability to evade the enemy’s attack would increase; on the other hand, constitution only shined when he took the enemy’s attack head on . </p>
<p>‘Of course, I’ll always need some minimum amount, just in case…’</p>
<p>Still, raising both agility and constitution at the same time did not seem like the best distribution of his points .  </p>
<p>After thinking about it for some time, he came to a conclusion:</p>
<p>First, agility . Second, sense . Third, constitution . </p>
<p>He had already invested quite a bit into strength, so he’ll leave it as is .  He’ll focus on bringing agility to a matching level; with the focus on agility, he’ll also put sense ahead of constitution . </p>
<p>Having made his decision, Jinwoo put 2 points into strength[0] . </p>

<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 50</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He just wanted to have his strength at an even 50 .  Wouldn’t anyone do the same?</p>
<p>He put the next 8 points into agility for the same reason .  He wanted the number to end on a nice “5” . </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Numbers always look nice when they’re in multiples of 5 . ’</p>
<p>50 strength and 35 agility .  The multiples of 5 gave him a pointless sense of satisfaction . </p>
<p>‘And the last 2 points . ’</p>
<p>He put them into sense .  And with that, the distribution of his points was over . </p>
<p>.  . </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The fact that he couldn’t get sense to 30 felt a little sad . </p>
<p>‘Can’t do much about it with no points left . ’</p>
<p>Other than that, everything looked good to him .  Constitution and intelligence would have to be raised through level-ups . </p>
<p>“Is this good enough?”</p>
<p>Of course, he could not be satisfied 100% in everything .  Still, having made the decision after much thought, he felt that it was good enough . </p>
<p>ring~ ring~</p>
<p>He heard the phone ring from the living room . </p>
<p>‘Is it a call from the Association?’</p>
<p>In the past, he would hold out picking up as long as he could, afraid to be called to Raids .  But now, his body was itching to face magic beasts with his raised attributes . He quickly went and picked up the receiver . </p>
<p>“This is Hunter Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>-”Ah, there you are . ”</p>
<p>It was not the Association .  Jinwoo felt a little disappointed . </p>
<p>-“Student Jinwoo, why haven’t you picked up the phone in a while?”</p>
<p>It was a familiar voice .  It had been 4 years since Jinwoo had graduated from high school and left behind the title of student, but the landlord, who had watched over Jinwoo since he was a kid, still called him one . </p>
<p>“Sorry landlord ahjussi . I was hospitalized for a while after an accident . ”</p>
<p>-“Oh no . Is that so? That explains that . So, er Student Jinwoo, I haven’t received this month’s rent yet . How is it, do you want to push it back to next month?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, that’s fine . I’ll send it now . ”</p>
<p>-“Ah, okay . Don’t push yourself too hard . I know you’re working hard to take care of your mom and little sister . Money is money, but don’t neglect your body . ”</p>
<p>“I understand . Thank you very much . ”</p>
<p>He ended the conversation and took out his bankbook[1] from a drawer .  His account had 800 thousand won . </p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>He could not help but let out a long breath .  After 500 thousand won for rent, the amount left over for living expenses this month would be just 300 thousand won[2] .  Even the 500 thousand rent was due to the fact that he lived at a worn-down apartment on the edges of the city; on top of that, the landlord, who had a soft heart for Jinwoo’s situation, had not raised the rent in the past few years .  </p>
<p>It would be hard to find a place for 500 thousand these days .  It would be even harder to live on 300 thousand for the month . </p>
<p>“First, let’s earn some money . ”</p>
<p>He had picked out the priority goal . </p>
<p>He was not the same man who had struggled in taking down a single E-rank magic beast . </p>
<p></p>
<p>How does a Hunter earn money?</p>
<p>The best way was to take down magic beasts . </p>
<p>The A-rank and S-rank Hunters had the luxury of being sponsored, filming commercials and making TV appearances, but they were in the minority .  For the rest, the Hunters earned their keep in Dungeons . </p>
<p>Your income was dependent on the quality and quantity of the Dungeon .  And your Dungeon was dependent on your capabilities . </p>
<p>Higher the Rank, higher the Dungeon .  More experienced you were, more Dungeons you could get into . </p>
<p>As an E-rank Hunter under the Association, Jinwoo had never entered anything above a D-rank Gate .  As such, he had neither the rank nor the experience to prove his worth . </p>
<p>Jinwoo furrowed his brows . </p>
<p>‘Forget any conditions, if I could only get into a raiding party[3] . ’</p>
<p>He browsed through the job boards[4] on Hunter websites and even made a few phone calls but made no progress .  Nobody wanted an E-rank Hunter . The Hunters who put up listings on the job boards were there for personal raids .  As such, they were looking for reliable people to watch their backs and were strict in their criteria for selection . </p>
<p>These people were those that fell in an awkward place in the Hunter world .  Too weak for Guilds but too strong to work under the Association . </p>
<p>‘Even those Hunters make several ten million a month . ’</p>
<p>High risk, high return .  Putting their lives on the line, the reward was just as great .  There was a reason Hunters were the target of envy . To Jinwoo, it was rather frustrating . </p>
<p>‘Should I just go get retested[5] and raise my rank?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo shook his head .  No matter how long he thought about it, it was a stupid idea .  It didn’t matter if his new rank was A-rank, B-rank or even C-rank .  A Hunter’s Reawakening would be big news . The people loved gossip, and Hunters made prime gossip material .  If he got re-tested now and entered the public’s perception, it would only be a matter of time before his special circumstances would be discovered .  After all, he had no plans to stop his growth . </p>
<p>.  . </p>
<p>“A Hunter that can raise his abilities?”</p>
<p>“He gets stronger with time?”. “Who is that Hunter?”</p>
<p>“How could he do such a thing?”</p>
<p>“How could I do something like that?”</p>
<p>Surely, many people would become interested .  There was never a Hunter like him in history . Amidst their interest, there would definitely be those that would try to use him or antagonize him . </p>
<p>‘And if any of them are stronger than me…’</p>
<p>The thought scared Jinwoo .  He still lacked power . Until he was confident in his ability to protect himself, he did not want to reveal himself to the world .  So, a ranking retest was out of the question . </p>
<p>‘Still, I need a way to make money somehow…’</p>
<p>He couldn’t get an ordinary job .  He did not know when the Association would come calling .  If he got called to a Raid, he would be able to earn experience points and money; he didn’t want to throw that chance away for some pocket money . </p>
<p>As Jinwoo pondered on what he could do, he noticed a new listing on the job board . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>We’ll take anyone, regardless of ranking, first come first serve!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>His eyes shot open .  It was a newly created post .  Quickly checking the details, he realized the location wasn’t far from his house .  Jinwoo quickly picked up the phone . As if waiting, the other side also picked up quickly . </p>
<p>-“Hello?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo gave a brief introduction and inquired about the job posting .  </p>
<p>-“Ah, you’re an E-rank?”</p>
<p>The response was better than he had hoped . </p>
<p>-“That’s fine .  You just have to come and help us fill the headcount .  But since it’s a C-rank Gate, you probably won’t be much help in the fighting .  So we’ll have to leave you out of the loot distribution . Instead, we’ll give you a flat amount of 2 million, how’s that sound? Could you make it?”</p>
<p>Flat amount of 2 million!</p>
<p>It was an incredible compensation for just filling the headcount .  The conditions were not that bad . Although regrettable that he’d be excluded from the loot, he could not let 2 million slip out of his hands . </p>
<p>‘For now, let’s start with this . ’</p>
<p>An opportunity like this didn’t come every day .  2 million would be more than enough for the month . </p>
<p>Jinwoo accepted the proposition,</p>
<p>“I’ll be there in 15 minutes . ”</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[0]: This goddamn troll . </p>
<p>[1]: “bankbook” (통장): In Korea, people often have these physical representations of their bank balance, which also records deposits and withdrawals .  A relic from days before online banking, you’d have to take these to banks to get an update on your account status . They look like thin checkbooks . </p>
<p>[2]: Just a reminder, when converting from KRW to USD, just divide it by a thousand (it’ll be off by few %, but good enough for story purposes) .  His rent is ~$500 and he would have ~$300 left over for the month . </p>
<p>[3]: “raiding party” (공격대): “attack/attacking” 공격 + “group” 대 .  Since the context refers to hunters that would group up and attack a dungeon, I decided to translate it as “raiding party” . </p>
<p>[4]: “job board” (구인란): “wanted” 구인 “board/column” 란 .  Normally refers to “wanted” section or “classified” in newspapers .  I really wanted to call it the “LFG” board of the Hunter website but thought that’d be going too far . </p>
<p>[5]: “retested” (재심사): “re/again” 재 + “test” 심사 .  I used it as a verb for the context but will come up as a noun in the future . </p>
