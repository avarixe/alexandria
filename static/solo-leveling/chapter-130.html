<h3>Chapter 130: Chapter 130</h3> 
<p>Jin-Woo locked his gaze on the young American man named Adam White, who turned out to be an agent of the Hunter Bureau </p>
<p>'… '. </p>
<p>Judging from the glint in that man's eyes, he obviously had no ill intentions towards Jin-Woo whatsoever </p>
<p>The Americans spending an exorbitant sum of money to bring in top Hunters from all over the globe was already a well-known fact . So, Jin-Woo figured that the guy would start extolling the virtues of coming to America soon after making his introduction </p>
<p>However, what Adam White said next went wildly against his expectations </p>
<p>"There is a piece of information we'd like to share with you, Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>"Information, is it ?". </p>
<p>"Yes . And you won't ever hear about this information from any other existing country or organisation in the world . Except ours, of course . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo tilted his head slightly . What would be their reason for revealing such highly-classified information to a foreign Hunter like him, a complete stranger?. </p>
<p>"Why are you willing to share such information with me?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's probing question only managed to elicit another round of a refreshing smile from Adam White </p>
<p>"We certainly will get something in return by revealing this information to an exclusive group of a specially chosen few . ". </p>
<p>"Specially chosen few", he said </p>
<p>Which meant that the Americans considered Jin-Woo to be eligible to enter that category now . Sure enough, that roused his curiosity rather greatly </p>
<p>"Okay, let's hear it . ". </p>
<p>"That is as far as I'm permitted to tell you, Hunter-nim . As for the rest, you'll have to hear it from our deputy director . ". </p>
<p>The deputy director of the mighty Hunter Bureau? A man who possessed more political clout than a minister of some government actually was in South Korea, right now?. </p>
<p>'Sounds like it can't be some run-of-the-mill info, then . '. </p>
<p>Adam White must've thought that he was successful in stoking the flames of Jin-Woo's curiosity, because he finally delved into the main topic at hand </p>
<p>"We have a car ready nearby . How about accompanying me to meet up with the deputy director?". </p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, though – it was Jin-Woo who had the final say in the matter </p>
<p>'Information, is it '. </p>
<p>It could only be one of two things . Either it was info that would benefit him in some way after learning of it, or a tip of someone coming after his life . Funnily enough, he didn't feel all that compelled to get to the bottom of this matter at the moment </p>
<p>For the time being, he wanted to focus on the preparations for the 'black key', even if this info proved to be beneficial to him . If it was the latter and someone indeed wanted to take him out, then he was pretty confident of emerging victorious from that, too </p>
<p>Also, most importantly . </p>
<p>'It's not like I can fully trust the information these guys will furnish me with, in the first place '. </p>
<p>This whole thing about sharing information could be just a ruse, too </p>
<p>He wasn't even sure of the opponent's hands being useful to him, or for that matter, if the opponent held any useful hands at all . So, was there a reason for him to be lead around by the nose here?. </p>
<p>He quickly arrived at his decision </p>
<p>"I'll sleep on it, and give you a call later . ". </p>
<p>" . !!". </p>
<p>Adam felt like someone had just punched him in the back of his head as this unexpected turn of the conversation left him reeling in shock </p>
<p>'What? The deputy director of the Hunter Bureau came all this way to share information, yet he's ignoring that and wants to go on his way??'. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn't look like he was bluffing here, because he was already opening the driver's door of the van . Cold perspiration immediately coated Adam White's forehead </p>
<p>If Hunter Seong Jin-Woo was allowed to slip through his fingers now, then who knew when he'd get another chance like this? No, there was even a distinct possibility that this could be the very last time </p>
<p>It was unknown whether the Korean intended for this reaction or not, but without a doubt, the ones ruing the missed opportunity would be them, not him </p>
<p>"Well, have a nice day . ". </p>
<p>Just as Jin-Woo was about to climb into the van, the restless Adam White urgently cried out </p>
<p>"P-please, hold on!". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo shifted his disinterested gaze over to Adam White . Hoping to rouse Jin-Woo's curiosity further, even if it was only by a fraction, Adam White hurriedly continued on </p>
<p>"Upgrader ". </p>
<p>"An Upgrader?". </p>
<p>Adam formed an expression of a defeated man and explained the meaning behind the word he just spat out </p>
<p>"Did you know that there is an Awakened who can enhance the abilities of other Awakened?". </p>
<p>'Yup, you should've started with that from the beginning . '. </p>
<p>Right away, Jin-Woo realised that the stuff being shared by Agent Adam White, no, the deputy director of the Hunter Bureau, was actually of far greater importance than mere 'information' </p>
<p>'An Awakened who can enhance other Awakened, is it . ?'. </p>
<p>Finally, Jin-Woo felt compelled enough now . He pulled the half-entered leg out of the van and closed the door . Adam could sigh a sigh of relief after seeing that </p>
<p>"Whew . ". </p>
<p>When he raised his head, though, Jin-Woo was already standing a couple of inches away from him </p>
<p>"Jesus H . Christ?!". </p>
<p>The startled Adam White took a step back in fright, but Jin-Woo didn't care about that and simply asked the man </p>
<p>"Where am I supposed to go?". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Screech-. </p>
<p>The black saloon carrying the two men came to a stop in front of a famous luxury hotel </p>
<p>"We're here . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo noted that the name of the hotel was the same as the one from the memo Yu Jin-Ho handed over to him not too long ago </p>
<p>'Wait, that English-speaking foreigner Yu Jin-Ho was talking about, could it have been one of these guys?'. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo followed after Adam White and climbed up to the suite where the deputy director was waiting for him </p>
<p>The deputy director of the Hunter Bureau, Michael Connor, failed to disguise his excitement at the sight of a certain Oriental man standing behind his subordinate </p>
<p>'Very good!'. </p>
<p>One of the more difficult aspects of negotiation was bringing the other party to the negotiating table . One could even declare that half the battle was won already by doing so </p>
<p>The deputy director smiled brightly and extended his hand to Jin-Woo for a cordial handshake </p>
<p>"My name is Michael Connor . I'm the deputy director of the Hunter Bureau . ". </p>
<p>His self-introduction was translated into fluent Korean with the speed of lightning by Adam White . Jin-Woo took the deputy director's hand and lightly shook it </p>
<p>"I'm Hunter Seong Jin-Woo . ". </p>
<p>Now that their brief introductions were over, they settled down on the opposing sides of a table . Adam remained standing next to his deputy director </p>
<p>"Before we start, have anyone claiming to be from foreign Hunter-related organisations tried to make contact with you before us?". </p>
<p>The deputy director directly fired the opening salvo </p>
<p>"No one, so far . ". </p>
<p>Once that anticipated answer was given, the deputy director formed a smile of pure satisfaction </p>
<p>'But, of course . There shouldn't be anyone else on Earth quicker than the United States of America . '. </p>
<p>Only the striker a step ahead of everyone else could score the winning goal, indeed </p>
<p>The deputy director didn't plan on wasting this golden chance that no one else had the luxury to enjoy yet – especially when his target was someone his superior officer ordered to reel over to their side, no matter the cost or the method </p>
<p>He didn't even try to beat around the bush and went straight to the topic at hand </p>
<p>"Allow me to be frank with you, Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim </p>
<p>With a solemn, determined face, the deputy director pushed a rather sizeable mountain of files towards Jin-Woo and continued on </p>
<p>"We, at the United States of America, want you, Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>"These are ?". </p>
<p>"These are all the documents needed to emigrate to America . Now normally, you'd need at least one or two years for these papers to be processed . However, it'll be a different story for you, Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>The deputy director then raised his index finger </p>
<p>"Just a single second . ". </p>
<p>He declared in a very confident voice </p>
<p>"If you agree to immigrate, then you'll become an American citizen in one second . And not as a simple, regular citizen, either – no, you become eligible to receive the equal treatment as the nation's existing top-ranked Hunters . ". </p>
<p>" . ". </p>
<p>Everything so far had been what Jin-Woo expected to hear from this man . However, what he wanted to find out about was the information related to this Awakened called 'Upgrader' . He shifted his gaze over to Adam, causing the American agent to flinch slightly and avert his eyes away </p>
<p>Jin-Woo looked back at the deputy director </p>
<p>"But, I only came here because Adam said something about some 'information' . ". </p>
<p>The deputy director let out a burst of genial laughter when he heard that </p>
<p>"That isn't entirely unrelated to what I was talking about . ". </p>
<p>"I don't understand . ". </p>
<p>"Hunter-nim . If you give us your word that you'll become the next American Hunter, then we will definitely enhance your abilities to an even higher realm . ". </p>
<p>The so-called 'Upgrader' . It seemed that this Awakened could really do what that moniker implied </p>
<p>Still, Jin-Woo was not entirely convinced, even if the deputy director said roughly the same thing as Agent Adam White </p>
<p>'Could there really be an Awakened possessing such a power?'. </p>
<p>That's why he decided to make d*mn sure </p>
<p>"To enhance one's abilities – can such a thing be for real?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's apparent interest caused the deputy director to become even more excited </p>
<p>"Actually she's here with us, right now . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo already knew that there was someone else within the hotel's suite . From a while ago, he had picked up on the minute amount of magic power leaking out from the gap of the closed door just over there </p>
<p>Because the magic energy emitted didn't seem all that powerful, he was inwardly thinking that person was too weak to be a bodyguard of someone as important as the Hunter Bureau's deputy director . And now, his suspicion proved to be correct </p>
<p>The deputy director quickly issued an order </p>
<p>"Please bring Madam Selner here . ". </p>
<p>Click </p>
<p>Almost immediately, the door was opened and two agents escorted a middle-aged African-American woman out from the room beyond . Jin-Woo's eyes narrowed slightly after picking up on a strange vibe coming off of her </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>Somehow, she gave off a different aura from other, regular Awakened </p>
<p>The African-American lady stood next to the table, and the agent quickly pulled out a chair for her . She then elegantly settled down on the end of the cushion </p>
<p>She immediately recognised who Jin-Woo was and floated a smile of genuine interest </p>
<p>"So, you are that man from the video ". </p>
<p>She was already familiar with all the important information on Jin-Woo and needed no introduction, so the deputy director's job became a bit easier </p>
<p>"This is Madam Norma Selner . She is the lone Awakened, the only one of her type in the entire world, who can enhance the abilities of other Awakened to even greater heights . ". </p>
<p>At the end of the introduction, Madam Selner did a simple nod of her head as a greeting to Jin-Woo . He reciprocated the greeting with the nod, as well </p>
<p>"Madam Selner . Please, if you will, briefly explain what you can do to Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>She formed a teasing smile while staring at the still-unconvinced Jin-Woo's face </p>
<p>"Everyone has the same look as you, in the beginning, Hunter-nim . However ". </p>
<p>She then leaned in closer to Jin-Woo and whispered softly to him </p>
<p>"Once they have a taste, they have no choice but to beg me for more . ". </p>
<p>"Madam, please ". </p>
<p>The deputy director furrowed his brows a little, prompting her to laugh out and wave her hand about </p>
<p>"I know, I know . Don't worry, Director Connor . I know that he's a very important man . ". </p>
<p>Still with an alluring smile, Madam Selner began with her explanation </p>
<p>"Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . As you may know already, all Awakened face a limit they can't breach . No one can overcome it . ". </p>
<p>That was why the ranks of the Awakened would never change, unless one was lucky enough to go through a Re-Awakening process . This was common knowledge that all living Hunters out there knew all too well </p>
<p>"But, Madam . You can ?". </p>
<p>Even before Jin-Woo could finish his question, Madam Selner formed an expression of a little kid picking up the final piece of strawberry on top of a cake that she'd been saving up for the very last </p>
<p>"You're correct . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's eyes grew progressively wider </p>
<p>"I can increase that limit even higher in three separate stages . I don't know whether to call it a forced Re-Awakening, or simply waking up the latent potential sleeping within the subject already, but yes, I can do it . ". </p>
<p>What an incredible ability that was!. </p>
<p>The things she said just now were explosive enough to shake the very cores of every top-ranked Hunters found throughout the world . Jin-Woo's gaze shifted over to the deputy director </p>
<p>He nodded his head to reaffirm what she said </p>
<p>"What she said are all true . It's just that, once she uses her powers once, she needs to take a lengthy break to recover her energy . So, only around three to four lucky Awakened get to enjoy this benefit in a single year . ". </p>
<p>" How effective is it?". </p>
<p>"It depends on individuals, but once one goes through all three stages, they say that they grew stronger by a minimum of 20 percent, and as much as 30 percent, over their original powers . ". </p>
<p>Twenty to thirty percent!. </p>
<p>With the average of his Stat values nearing the 250 mark, if Jin-Woo got that mystery enhancement, that average value would shoot past the 300 mark, instead,. </p>
<p>Without a doubt, that would be an enormous leap up </p>
<p>… . As long as these guys weren't lying to him, of course </p>
<p>'Is she casting a buff that raises one's powers? Or, is it more like raising the fixed level cap?'. </p>
<p>Regardless of what it was, the ability she possessed would be like a precious treasure for all the Hunters out there . Which also meant that there should be no shortages of people aiming for her, too </p>
<p>"If the knowledge of such an ability is made public, then ". </p>
<p>The deputy director nodded his head </p>
<p>"That is why Madam Selner is with us . ". </p>
<p>She too worried about the exact same thing as Jin-Woo had thought of, and after lengthy deliberation, she joined the Hunter Bureau who'd guarantee her safety while also letting her use her powers as often as she wanted to </p>
<p>"We ensure her absolute safety and reward her accordingly, while she enhances the abilities of those Hunters we deem worthy of joining us . We have been maintaining this symbiotic relationship for a long time now . ". </p>
<p>And so, that's where the deputy director bookended the explanation . Now, the time for the fireworks to begin </p>
<p>"Madam Selner's ability, that is precisely the gift we wish to give to you, Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>"A gift, is it ". </p>
<p>Indeed, could there be a gift even more valuable than this one?. </p>
<p>"If you become a Hunter of the United States of America, you will be the first in line to receive this benefit . Also, we will make sure that you get the best possible terms when negotiating with any Guilds you wish to join . ". </p>
<p>From the perspective of an ordinary Hunter, these were simply too good of conditions to say no to </p>
<p>Only now could Jin-Woo understand why Hwang Dong-Soo didn't even hesitate once and emigrated to the States when everyone was criticising him for it . The enormous sum of money the Americans reportedly paid him was most likely a cover-up story to hide the real reason </p>
<p>Regular Hunters would lose their collective sh*t if they ever heard of such a tale . So, if you told a top Hunter that his or her abilities could be enhanced even further? Who in their right minds would say no to that?. </p>
<p>However . </p>
<p>"Can you prove that she really possesses such a power?". </p>
<p>Everything they said so far were just words, and there had been no proof to back them up yet </p>
<p>It was her turn to butt in next </p>
<p>"No need to rush . Today, I'm only here to undo the first button, you know . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo finally realised what she meant earlier </p>
<p>'One taste, and people beg her for more, was it?'. </p>
<p>Just as she had alluded to, every Hunter seeing her powers with their own eyes chose to head to America right away, one hundred times out of one hundred . Her sky-high confidence was based off on that </p>
<p>The deputy director quietly asked a question to Jin-Woo </p>
<p>"It is as she says . So, will you let us unlock your 'first stage'?". </p>
<p>"Without anything in return?". </p>
<p>"Think of it as a 'service' from us, Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>Madam Selner lightly grasped Jin-Woo's wrist . When he turned to look at her, she formed a gentle smile and gestured to him to get closer </p>
<p>"Please, look into my eyes . Look deeply into them . That will be your first step . ". </p>
<p>Was she telling the truth?. </p>
<p>To confirm if this Madam Selner really did possess the power the Hunter Bureau was swearing by, Jin-Woo decided to follow her instructions for the time being </p>
<p>The deputy director leaned against the back of the chair and crossed his arms </p>
<p>'It's done! He's ours now!'. </p>
<p>The game was already over </p>
<p>Hunter Seong Jin-Woo had been constantly maintaining that cold, indifferent expression until now, but that was only because he hadn't yet experienced what this lady's power had to offer </p>
<p>Once the first lifting of the natural limit was completed, Hunter Seong Jin-Woo would call them on his own volition sooner rather than later . No, if he had an impulsive personality, then he might sign the immigration documents right here, right now </p>
<p>The deputy director's curiosity shifted on to something else now </p>
<p>'Just how high will his limit be, I wonder?'. </p>
<p>The deputy director uncrossed his arms and rubbed his chin, his eyes of anticipation firmly locked on Jin-Woo . But, it was then </p>
<p>"Heok!!". </p>
<p>Madam Selner sucked in her breath, as her eyes began to quake quite violently </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 130 &gt; Fin </p>
