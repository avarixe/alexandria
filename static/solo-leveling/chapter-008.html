<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 8</p>
<p>Startled by the deep voice that spoke to him from a corner, Jinwoo straightened his back and turned his head towards the source . </p>
<p>“I apologize if I’ve surprised you . ”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we can’t afford to delay here any longer . ”</p>
<p>Two men, dressed in black suits, walked towards the bed . </p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head and asked,</p>
<p>“May I ask . who you are?”</p>
<p>He did not recognize their faces .  One of the men, sporting a military-esque short hair, handed him a business card . </p>
<p>“This is where we’re from . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo read the card he received,</p>
<p>‘Korean Hunter Association, Hunter Surveillance Department[1], Section Chief Woo Jincheol?’</p>
<p>Of all the departments of the Hunter Association, the Hunter Surveillance Department (HSD) was the only one composed of strong Hunters .  As the department in charge of monitoring and keeping the Hunters in line, it made sense that it would be filled with high-level Hunters . </p>
<p>“What does the Hunter Surveillance Department want with me?”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol pulled up a chair and sat down .  The other man who appeared to be his junior stood behind him .  With the two men’s imposing physique close before him, Jinwoo felt a great deal of pressure . </p>
<p>They began explaining the situation .  As he listened to their words, Jinwoo uttered in surprise,</p>
<p>“I was asleep for four days?”</p>
<p>“Do you by any chance remember anything before you lost consciousness?”</p>
<p>“I think so . ”</p>
<p>“Could you please tell us your recollection?”</p>
<p>Leaving aside the detail regarding the mysterious voice, he recalled everything he went through until his passing out . </p>
<p>“…And so that’s when you lost consciousness, is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes .  When I opened my eyes, I was here . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol and his junior exchanged glances .  Since the victim of the incident did not appear to know anything, they were at a loss regarding the situation .  Of course, the one who wanted to know what happened the most was Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“How did I end up here? Did a large Guild take care of those things?”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol explained awkwardly,</p>
<p>“…After being contacted by the survivors, the Hunter Surveillance Department and Baekho Guild arrived at the scene of the incident, only to find…”</p>
<p>With a large member count, Baekho Guild was one of the top 5 Guilds of Korea .  If they were pulled into the situation by the Association, it meant the Association had recognized the magnitude of the danger .  Jinwoo gulped, just what had happened there?</p>
<p>“To find…?”</p>
<p>“Nothing .  Everything had disappeared .   No traces of any statues or that Statue of God .  Only the unconscious Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim, lying in the middle of the room . ”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s expression was one of disbelief . </p>
<p>“We couldn’t believe it either .  If there were any gaps or disconnects between the survivors’ statements, or if we hadn’t found the remains of the other victims, we might’ve suspected some other possibility . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol scratched his chin .  It had been 6 years since he Awakened as an A-ranker and started working in the HSD .  He felt like he had seen everything since then, but this was the first time he had come across something like this .  Even after reaching out to other Guilds and contacting foreign agencies, no one had ever heard of what the survivors described . </p>
<p>And that’s why,</p>
<p>“It’s just a theory at the moment…”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol carefully started,</p>
<p>“It’s undeniable that there were dangerous entities in that room .  But someone or some people had taken care of them all . Until the Gate closed, no otherworldly existences came out of it . ”</p>
<p>They had to consider all possibilities, no matter how unlikely .  After much deliberation, the Association had come to a possible answer . </p>
<p>Woo Jincheol looked at Jinwoo and continued,</p>
<p>“We… we believe that there is a possibility Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim may have undergone a Second Awakening . [2]”</p>
<p>A Second Awakening!</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened .  It was a rare event, one where a person who had Awakened underwent another Awakening .  More commonly known as ‘Reawakening’[3], nearly all the Hunters that Awakened again after their first Awakening received an incredible amount of power .  Under normal circumstances, the power that someone received after Awakening could not be increased; as such, a Hunter’s power was fixed at the amount they received in their first Awakening .  This was not the case for the Reawakened Hunters . Leaping over their original limit, there were cases of C-rank Hunters becoming A-rank, and B-rank Hunters becoming S-rank . </p>
<p>Woo Jincheol gulped . </p>
<p>‘Sung Jinwoo… If he underwent a Reawakening and achieved a power of an S-rank, no, perhaps even a greater power, it’s possible that he single-handedly took care of the monsters described by the survivors . ’</p>
<p>The Association employee recalled the enemies from the gruesome tales .  Especially that Statue of God; the survivors described how it was able to disintegrate a C-rank Hunter just with its eye beams .   To slay that kind of a monster in an unconscious state, just what kind of power were they talking about here? In preparation of such a possibility, the Association had put a moratorium on the information regarding incident and requested the silence of all those involved . </p>
<p>The reason why Sung Jinwoo was placed in a private room in the hospital and provided the best medical assistance was the same .  Woo Jincheol’s heartbeat quickened . </p>
<p>‘Perhaps… There’s a chance that Korea might be able to obtain a Nation-level Hunter[4]…’</p>
<p>An existence whose individual might surpassed that of nuclear weapons; the number of Nation-level Hunters across the world was in the single digits .  Woo Jincheol contained his excitement at the thought of such power being born here in his own country . </p>
<p>Thankfully, it was easy to confirm a person’s Reawakening .  Woo Jincheol gestured to his subordinate,</p>
<p>“Bring it . ”</p>
<p>And the man went to the corner and carefully took something out of a bag . </p>
<p>“Is that-”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol responded before Jinwoo could finish his question,</p>
<p>“It’s a tool to measure magic power[5]”</p>
<p>It was a portable version of the Association’s official measurement device, located at their headquarters, but the difference in their capabilities were not that big . </p>
<p>“Just place your hand here . ”</p>
<p>He gestured towards the Magic Core embedded on top of the device .  A size of a human fist, its black color was reminiscent of a black hole .  The Core was something that came from A-rank Magic Beasts; the highest quality item that carried a price of 1 billion won . </p>
<p>Seeing his silent gaze towards the Magic Core, Woo Jincheol asked again with a stern expression,</p>
<p>“This will be crucial to our investigation of the incident .  May we ask for your cooperation?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded . </p>
<p>Reawakening .  The thing of his dreams .  If it truly had happened to him, it would completely turn his life around .  And if they were offering to check it for free? Why shouldn’t he accept?</p>
<p>He placed his hand on the Magic Core, and the stone responded by radiating a faint light .  The Association employees’ foreheads moistened with cold sweat . </p>
<p>hum~</p>
<p>Then the light surrounding the Magic Core disappeared .  Removing his sunglasses, Woo Jincheol checked the results .  His eyes started shaking at what he saw . </p>
<p>“This can’t be!”</p>
<p>No matter how many times he checked, the numbers stayed the same . </p>
<p>‘How could this be…?’</p>
<p>How could the magic power of a man who had the qualifications to obtain a Hunter license be only 10?!  Even though they stood at the lowest of the ranks, the average magic power of an E-rank Hunter was still between 70 and 100 .  Compared to this, Sung Jinwoo was barely above an ordinary person . </p>
<p>“Is it Reawakening? If it is, what rank am I now?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo clenched his sweating hands .  Looking at the responses of the HSD staff, he suspected a great result .  Meanwhile, Woo Jincheol looked at Jinwoo’s historical data and the current results . </p>
<p>‘His first result was 12 .  And four years later, 10 . It decreased by 2, but that’s within a margin of error . ’</p>
<p>So it was not the fault of the measuring device .  Sung Jinwoo’s powers were simply incredibly weak . The fact that he was able to come this far was nothing short of a miracle . </p>
<p>Concluding that any more time spent was time wasted, Woo Jincheol rose from his seat . </p>
<p>“Let’s go . ”</p>
<p>“Yes sir . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo started speaking to the two men who were packing up,</p>
<p>“Wait, please say something-“</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol nodded at the young man,</p>
<p>“Thank you for your cooperation .  If you remember anything else, please feel free to contact us . ”</p>
<p>Moving as if they wanted to be somewhere else, the two men quickly left the hospital .  The hospital room that felt cramped until moments ago now felt empty . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo rubbed the back of his neck . </p>
<p>‘Guess it was nothing after all…’</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, other than the fact that his condition felt great, nothing else seemed different about him .  And even if he had undergone Reawakening, it was probably impossible for him to defeat all the enemies in that place . </p>
<p>‘I wonder if Hunter Choi Jongin, the “Strongest Soldier”, or Hunter Go Kwonhee, the “S-rank among S-ranks”, could’ve taken them on?’</p>
<p>As he had never seen those two in action, he had no way of knowing .  There was a lot of secrets behind the information regarding the S-rank Hunters, whose existences were regarded highly as the clouds in the sky .  It was in that moment of contemplation, he noted something . </p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>In front of his eyes, words were floating in the middle of the air . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You have unread messages . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes then opened them . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You have unread messages . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The floating letters did not disappear .  He shook his head and rubbed his eyes, but the words still remained .  He put his palms to his forehead and lowered his head . </p>
<p>‘On top of hearing voices, now I’m seeing things…’</p>
<p>Did something happen to his head? He recalled the condition known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .  Having lost a large number of comrades, his own life reaching the brink of death, it was not weird that his mind might’ve broken down somehow . </p>
<p>‘But…’</p>
<p>Before he could settle on that simple conclusion, there was something else lingering in his mind .  He looked towards his legs . </p>
<p>The leg that had been cleanly removed by that statue’s shield was now attached to his body, as if nothing had ever happened .  </p>
<p>A temple hidden away in a Double Dungeon, the voice in his head, the spontaneous healing of his leg, and now this message . </p>
<p>Too many things were happening . </p>
<p>‘What if… . ’</p>
<p>The occurrences were not separate instances, but connected somehow?</p>
<p>As he arrived at that conclusion, the thoughts that clouded his head cleared up a little . </p>
<p>‘Okay . ’</p>
<p>He raised his head .  With his agitation gone, and his heart feeling lighter, his curiosity turned to the contents of the message .  Perhaps it contained the clues that may help him solve the many mysteries . </p>
<p>He stretched his hands toward the floating words . </p>
<p>They passed right through them . </p>
<p>‘Guess it’s not a touch screen . ’</p>
<p>He was too used to using a smartphone and couldn’t think of another way .  As he wondered on how he would open the message, he recalled his last moments in the temple . </p>
<p>“Ah, right . ”</p>
<p>He remembered his last interaction with the mysterious voice was through words . </p>
<p>‘Then I should just give the commands in my head or speak them out loud?’</p>
<p>To test his theory, Jinwoo repeated all the phrases he could think of that might work:</p>
<p>“Confirm . ”</p>
<p>“Message . ”</p>
<p>“Confirm message . ”</p>
<p>“Check message . ”</p>
<p>“View . ”</p>
<p>“I’ll view . ”</p>
<p>“Show me . ”</p>
<p>“Show me!”</p>
<p>“…What do you want to see so much?”</p>
<p>He turned his heads toward the voice .  Peeking through the half open door, his little sister in her school uniform was coldly staring at him . </p>
<p>“Er…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was at a loss for words . </p>
<p>An oppa[6] that was making a request to the ceiling for something . </p>
<p>He could not find the words to explain . </p>
<p> .  . </p>
<p> .  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Hunter Surveillance Department” (감시과): “Surveillance/Monitoring” 감시 + “Department” 과 .  I’ve decided to add “Hunter” in front of the department to distinguish it going forward and will shorten it to “HSD” when they come up again . </p>
<p>[2]: “Second Awakening” (각성 후 각성): Lit . “Awakening after Awakening”, but I shortened to “second awakening” due to the usage as a noun in the passage .  No impact on story down the line . </p>
<p>[3]: “Reawakening” (재각성): This is more literal translation than the above . </p>
<p>[4]: “Nation-level” (국가 권력급): “nation/country” 국가 + “power/authority” 권력 + “level” 급 .  I shortened it to Nation-level . </p>
<p>[5]: “It’s a tool to measure magic power” (마력 측정기): Pretty straight forward, “magic power” 마력 + “measurement device” 측정기</p>
<p>[6]: “oppa” (오빠): Like ahjussi, a commonly used korean noun .  A way for little sisters to call their older brothers . It’s also used in general population between unrelated people (female addressing an older male of a close age) . </p>
