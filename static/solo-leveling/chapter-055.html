<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 55</p>
<p>While staring at the screen in happiness, Jinwoo noticed something else . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Title: Wolf Slayer ( . 1 more)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘ . One more?’</p>
<p>Ah .  He suddenly remembered that the reward from the class advancement quest did say something about a new title .  Jinwoo checked the hidden title . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>One Who Has Triumphed Over Adversity</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>For every 1% HP lost, all stats increased by 1% . </strong>.   </p>
<p>It’s a title given to the one who has courageously endured against adversity . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘I like it!’</p>
<p>It was an amazing buff that would increase all of his attributes as he lost life .  The ‘Wolf Slayer’ was a decent title on its own, increasing his attributes by 40% against beast-type monsters .  However, its condition made it difficult to see the benefit most of the time . </p>
<p>‘If I’m facing something other than a beast-type, it’s as if I didn’t have a title . ’</p>
<p>And now, he had earned something that he could always use .  After thinking about it, it even had a good synergy with the ‘Unyielding Spirit’ passive .  Without a hesitation, Jinwoo changed his title . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Title: One Who… ( . 1 more)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The unused title would be hidden, but he could always swap it out when he needed it . </p>
<p>‘Next, stats . ’</p>
<p>There were three rewards he had received after reaching a high amount of advancement points . </p>
<p>The first was the advancement to a higher class . </p>
<p>The second was the new title . </p>
<p>And the third was bonus stats . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 132</p>
<p>Constitution: 91</p>
<p>Agility: 111</p>
<p>Intelligence: 70</p>
<p><strong>Sense: 93</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>(Available stat points: 10)</strong>.   </p>
<p>Physical Damage Reduction: 46%</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>There were 10 undistributed points .  In the past, he would’ve invested them into agility or sense, but things were different now .  Jinwoo put all 10 points into intelligence . Even still, the stat was only at 80 . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 132</p>
<p>Constitution: 91</p>
<p>Agility: 111</p>
<p>Intelligence: 80</p>
<p><strong>Sense: 93</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>(Available stat points: 0)</strong>.   </p>
<p>Physical Damage Reduction: 46%</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Compared to strength or agility, it was really lacking .  It even fell behind the constitution stat, which he had neglected because he wanted to raise agility higher .  That was how much Jinwoo had left behind the intelligence stat . </p>
<p>‘I never thought I’d be using magic . ’</p>
<p>His plan for the time being was to invest every point into intelligence .  However, Jinwoo did not plan to switch up his fighting style . </p>
<p>‘Man, even the other new skill feels like it belongs to Assassin-class . ’</p>
<p>It was the new skill he had learned during combat . </p>
<p>Dagger Throw . </p>
<p>He did not need to read the explanation to understand what it was . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Dagger Throw (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Active Skill</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Mana Cost: 30</strong>.   </p>
<p>Dagger-specific</p>
<p><strong>Throw your dagger to inflict damage . </strong>.   </p>
<p>As the skill level increases, the accuracy and damage increases . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘As I thought . ’</p>
<p>He had fought like a Fighter-class up until now .  Just because he had earned a new class and class-specific skills, he couldn’t just throw away his way of fighting .  For now, he would use the shadow skills as a support and continue to wield the dagger . </p>
<p>‘At least, until my intelligence is high enough . ’</p>
<p>An outstanding combat skill, supported by the shadow army .  His goal before receiving the class was unchanged . </p>
<p>‘Only difference is ’</p>
<p>The Shadow Soldiers appeared more useful than he thought .  He did not think it was possible to subordinate a boss-level monster . </p>
<p>‘ . Still . ’</p>
<p>If he relied solely on those new skills, the dagger-specific skills he had obtained would be wasted .  On top of that, he had just purchased Knight Killer . </p>
<p>‘If I knew I was going to be a Mage-class, I would’ve bought a staff or something . ’</p>
<p>Of course, had he done that, he might not have been able to finish the class advancement quest . </p>
<p>Jinwoo closed the status screen .  He had sufficiently absorbed all of the new information . </p>
<p>‘Oh shit, the time . ’</p>
<p>He had spent 20 minutes going through everything .  Jinwoo scratched his head . </p>
<p>‘Time to head out, I guess . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo smirked .  The power of the attributes did not shine just in fighting magic beasts .  When he focused, time slowed down . More accurately, Jinwoo had sped up . He opened the door and went outside of his room .  </p>
<p>Shower .  Dry . Put on clothes . </p>
<p>It took him 3 minutes . </p>
<p>He could’ve done it faster, but he felt like the worn down apartment would not be able to withstand his full speed . </p>
<p>‘My hair’s still wet . ’</p>
<p>Still, he had basically saved about 20 minutes, so there was no need to hurry .  Jinwoo was about to leave when realized he forgot something . </p>
<p>His keys . </p>
<p>The keys were on top of the desk .  On any other day, he would’ve walked over in annoyance to grab them .  Today, he stretched a hand towards it . </p>
<p>‘Where else would I use this?’</p>
<p>Ruler’s Hands!</p>
<p>The key slowly slid across the table, then shot into his hand as if pulled by a powerful magnet .  Jinwoo grabbed the key and smiled . Having finished all preparations in a flash, Jinwoo left his house while whistling . </p>
<p>The first place he visited was the bank .  He was curious on how much he had earned from the magic cores . </p>
<p>‘I was too busy to check it . ’</p>
<p>The management of the magic cores were left to the Raid Leader, Yoo Jinho .  The young man had told him that he had sold all the magic cores after each day’s Raids .  The funds were deposited into the bankbook Jinwoo was holding . However, they did not particularly discuss the actual amounts involved . </p>
<p>‘Jinho, that punk . He’s so good at reporting on everything else . Guess he doesn’t really have an interest in money . ’</p>
<p>Maybe because of the circumstances of his life, the young man probably had little interest in financial matters .  His conversation topics mostly revolved around celebrities, Raids, music and movies . Well, “conversation” mostly entailed Yoo Jinho talking while Jinwoo just silently nodded along . </p>
<p>‘Hmm, also…’</p>
<p>When Jinwoo thought back on the times he spent with Yoo Jinho, the chattermouth had never talked about his family .  It was strange . </p>
<p>Before Jinwoo could give it more thought, he arrived at the bank . </p>
<p>‘Of all the days…’</p>
<p>The ATMs were being serviced . </p>
<p>Defeated, Jinwoo grabbed a number and waited .  Soon, he was called and went up to the counter . </p>
<p>“Hello . ”</p>
<p>The female service employee had a short hair and a bright smile .  She asked helpfully,</p>
<p>“How may I help you today?”</p>
<p>“Could I get some help with this?”</p>
<p>“Of course . ”</p>
<p>The employee took the bankbook from Jinwoo’s hands with a smile .  While waiting, Jinwoo looked around the bank . Even though it was a weekday afternoon, there were unusually many people around .  While he was people watching, the bank employee took a look at Jinwoo’s bankbook and was surprised . </p>
<p>‘Holy!’</p>
<p>[Account Balance: 1,482,920,000]</p>
<p>She carefully reread the number, counting the zeroes; it was definitely over a billion .  And the amount wasn’t some life saving . The transaction history showed that it was all collected in the past week . </p>
<p>‘He’s so young, how could he…?’</p>
<p>She had first thought of Jinwoo as a college student who was running bankbook errands for his mother .  Now, she stared at the man with a completely different look . She carefully asked him a question with a slight ulterior motive . </p>
<p>“So… what do you do?”</p>
<p>Realizing how her question sounded, the employee became embarrassed and looked away with her cheeks reddening . </p>
<p>“I’m a Hunter . ”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>The employee nodded .  The rumors were true . </p>
<p>‘I heard that Hunters earned a lot of money . ’</p>
<p>To think it would be this much .  She suddenly felt a shame at her ordinary desk job .  Just until moments ago, Jinwoo was just a customer like any other .  Now, she realized he lived in a different world . </p>
<p>‘He’s probably a really high-ranking Hunter . ’</p>
<p>Only they would earn this much money .  This was the first high-ranker she had met .  The thought made her heart flutter . A young man like him with over a billion in cash would be considered a VIP at this bank .  And if he was a Hunter on top of that, he would be a VVIP . She did not want to miss the opportunity . The employee started to go off as mandated by her training,</p>
<p>“So, there’s a new product for VIP customers at our bank,”</p>
<p>Her business-use smile had turned into a genuine one; her eyes were fixed on Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Oh my, he’s…’</p>
<p>The man looked like he had left his house in a hurry, wearing carefree clothes and unstyled hair still slightly wet .  She realized he probably lived a very busy life and took valuable time out of it to come here . Looking at such a capable man (in her head), her heart beat slightly faster . </p>
<p>“It’s been very popular with the customers . Would you perhaps like to invest in it?”</p>
<p>But Jinwoo held out a hand . </p>
<p>“No, I’m good . ”</p>
<p>“Ah… Okay . ”</p>
<p>She could not hide the disappointment in her voice .  Feeling like a lengthy conversation might follow, Jinwoo hurried and got up . </p>
<p>“Thank you for your hard work . ”</p>
<p>While ignoring the gaze of the employee on the back of his neck, he left the bank .  The moment he went outside, he sighed in relief . </p>
<p>“Whew-”</p>
<p>He had noticed change in her eyes after he revealed that he was a Hunter .  The gazes of others . And their interest . It was something normal for other Hunters but not to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘I suppose I have to get used to that . ’</p>
<p>Once he took the retest and obtained a high rank, the attention on him would become a lot heavier .  He had heard that Hunters even had their own share of fans and paparazzi . Looking up, he saw a billboard on top of a building with an advertisement; the model was a famous Hunter .  Before the days of the Gates, it would’ve been an athlete or a celebrity . Now, Hunters received the love of the masses . Jinwoo might become the same . Now days, the only people who disliked Hunters were insurance companies . </p>
<p>‘Well, anyways . ’</p>
<p>After leaving the bank, Jinwoo was finally able to check his income .  He was very surprised . </p>
<p>‘1,482,920,000…!!!’</p>
<p>The income from 9 Raids was nearly a billion and a half .  It was an average of 160 million per C-rank Dungeon . Considering the C-rank Dungeon with Hwang Dongseok paid out 180 million, he roughly determined that C-rank Gates would give 150~200 million each . </p>
<p>‘Well, any employee would be surprised after looking at this . ’</p>
