<h3>Chapter 168: Chapter 168</h3> <p>Yu Myung-Han spoke frankly about his current situation </p>
<p>“Actually, I also suffer from the exact same illness as your mother, Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>That completely unexpected reply took Jin-Woo by surprise and he froze up momentarily </p>
<p>“… . Does Jin-Ho know?”. </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Han shook his head </p>
<p>“Aside from my personal physician, only three others know of my condition . Myself, my wife, and my secretary . ”. </p>
<p>“And now, it’s four . ”. </p>
<p>“Indeed . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo nodded his head </p>
<p>Only now did he understand why Chairman Yu didn’t bother to go through Yu Jin-Ho and instead contacted him secretly like this . Yu Myung-Han wanted to hide his own illness from the rest of his family </p>
<p>‘But then again – his shoulders are carrying the fate of several tens of thousands of employees, aren’t they… . ’. </p>
<p>If the rumour of the days that Chairman Yu could freely move about being numbered got out, then it didn’t take a genius to see what might happen to Yujin Construction as well as its subsidiaries in the near future </p>
<p>The reason for hiding the status of his illness even from his family and keeping a tight leash on the information – Chairman Yu simply carried far too much weight on his shoulders to accept his reality as it was </p>
<p>Even then…. </p>
<p>‘He revealed this secret to me . ’. </p>
<p>It was probably because he had figured out that he needed to take the risk this time </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Han was a businessman . Not only that, he was someone whose vocabulary didn’t include the word ‘failure’ . He was, simply put, a general undefeated in all of his battles so far </p>
<p>Such a man would not jump into anything while carrying significant risk if there was nothing to gain from it </p>
<p>Jin-Woo could pretty much guess what Chairman Yu was about to say </p>
<p>Sure enough – the older man spoke up with a determined expression </p>
<p>“I have been scouring the world for a cure, a method, to rid myself of this illness for a while . In the process, I was able to discover that a single patient has gained her freedom from this dastardly illness . ”. </p>
<p>As Jin-Woo expected, the conversation was heading down the path he thought it might </p>
<p>“I don’t think it a coincidence that the sole patient recovering from the illness happens to be your mother, Seong Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo had left many in sheer shock and astonishment with his never-before-seen mysterious abilities . Could he have somehow cured his mother’s illness with his strange but wonderful abilities?. </p>
<p>Chairman Yu had used various avenues to investigate Jin-Woo, which meant that him arriving at such a deduction wasn’t so far-fetched at all </p>
<p>‘…… . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn’t deny nor agree with the claim and quietly stared at Chairman Yu . The latter swallowed his saliva </p>
<p>‘I cannot afford to make a mistake here . ’. </p>
<p>If the talk so far was nothing more than a practice match, an appetizer, then the real game was about to kick off now . This was the most important moment </p>
<p>Yu Myung-Han let out a deep but short breath and spoke up with some conviction </p>
<p>“What I’d like to earn from you is the truth, Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>He then pushed the cheque forward a little bit more with his hand </p>
<p>“And as your compensation, this is just merely a small part of what I’m willing to provide you with, Seong Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>Not everything, but merely a part, he said </p>
<p>Meaning, he was prepared to hand over something else besides money if that’s what Jin-Woo wanted </p>
<p>“If you help me out on this matter, Hunter-nim, I shall never forget this favour for the rest of my life . ”. </p>
<p>The tiger of the financial world lowered his head and asked for help . If those people who knew Chairman Yu saw this spectacle, they would have cried out in sheer shock just then </p>
<p>However, perhaps surprisingly, Jin-Woo remained calm even though he was on the receiving end of this plea . His collected gaze quietly studied Chairman Yu </p>
<p>‘Doesn’t seem like he’s lying to me . ’. </p>
<p>The older man’s raised heart rate, his quickened breathing, and the desperately pleading expression hidden beneath the facade of unflappable calm told Jin-Woo everything he needed to know </p>
<p>Chairman Yu was being truthful here </p>
<p>However, just because someone earnestly wished to get his hands on something, that didn’t mean he’d be successful every single time . After a short deliberation later, Jin-Woo finally opened his tightly-shut mouth </p>
<p>“I’m sorry . ”. </p>
<p>That one short sentence caused Yu Myung-Han’s eyes to tremble quite powerfully </p>
<p>“It is unfortunate, but that’s not something I can help you with . ”. </p>
<p>“I-in that… case . ”. </p>
<p>As his hopes riding on this talk had been far too great, Chairman Yu couldn’t easily accept his defeat here </p>
<p>“…How did… your mother become cured, Seong Hunter-nim?”. </p>
<p>“Chairman . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s expression became rather serious </p>
<p>The surrounding air began to grow chilly all of a sudden . That was enough to remind Chairman Yu just what kind of a person he was dealing with right now </p>
<p>Jin-Woo continued on </p>
<p>“Hypothetically speaking, if I knew how the illness had been cured and I wished to get rich from that, why would I have kept my mouth shut until now?”. </p>
<p>A handful of possible answers fleeted in and out of Chairman Yu’s mind . Was it because Jin-Woo was scared of becoming a target of someone influential? But, that couldn’t be </p>
<p>Chairman Yu immediately shook his head </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was the currently-active rank S Hunter . Not only that, he was an especially powerful one, too . Just who would dare to think of him as a target, then?. </p>
<p>Did this mean he wanted something else besides money?. </p>
<p>Unknown to himself, Chairman Yu’s own head moved from side to side once more . The current Hunter Seong was capable enough to get all the fame and recognition one could desire, if that was what he wanted . But then, he hadn’t done that, either </p>
<p>‘… . Ah . ’. </p>
<p>Chairman Yu belatedly realised what his mistake was this time ’round </p>
<p>One of the basics in negotiation was finding out what the other party wanted in advance . You’d bring in something the other side wanted and in turn, you got what you wanted from them . That was how a negotiation worked </p>
<p>However, Chairman Yu didn’t know what Jin-Woo wanted . Not even one thing . It was only obvious that the negotiation would fail like this </p>
<p>‘So, it must be one of the two possibilities . ’. </p>
<p>Either Jin-Woo really didn’t know what cured his mother, or Yu Myung-Han simply didn’t have what he wanted . Whatever the case may have been, it was still a despairing result for Chairman Yu either way </p>
<p>“… . I see . ”. </p>
<p>Chairman Yu no longer clung onto Jin-Woo </p>
<p>“Well, in that case . ”. </p>
<p>The older man saw that Jin-Woo was getting up to leave, so he also got up in haste and summoned Secretary Kim . The latter guarding the door quickly entered the office </p>
<p>“Chair…”. </p>
<p>The moment he took his first step inside, he immediately read the frozen atmosphere flowing between Jin-Woo and Chairman Yu . This meeting was the final ray of hope for his boss so even Kim’s complexion darkened rather quickly </p>
<p>“Sir, have you called for me?”. </p>
<p>Chairman Yu powerlessly nodded his head </p>
<p>“Hunter-nim wishes to return . Please take him back to his residence . ”. </p>
<p>“No, I’ll be fine . Thank you . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo tactfully declined the offer, and after leaving short goodbyes to both Yu Myung-Han and Secretary Kim, he climbed aboard the elevator all alone </p>
<p>Weeeiing…. </p>
<p>The lift moved at a frightening pace from the penthouse floor right down to the lobby </p>
<p>He hadn’t noticed it while riding it with someone else, but now that he was alone, he could tell for sure – this elevator was simply far too large and wide for only one person to ride in </p>
<p>Jin-Woo spat out a long sigh,. </p>
<p>“Fuu… . ”. </p>
<p>He didn’t feel so well after rejecting the request . Wasn’t that man the father of someone he treated like a little brother? He could’ve extended his helping hand while pretending to be defeated by his emotions </p>
<p>However… </p>
<p>‘I don’t know him . ’. </p>
<p>He didn’t know just what kind of a man Chairman Yu Myung-Han was . He didn’t know whether he was really suffering from the illness, or he was scheming something else </p>
<p>The ‘Divine Water of Life’ used to cure his mother might possess an otherworldly healing property, but its supply was also limited . And that was why he simply had to be more circumspect with their usages </p>
<p>The terms put forward by Chairman Yu indeed had been incredibly tempting, but in the end, they failed to change Jin-Woo’s mind . This was the end result </p>
<p>Ting </p>
<p>The elevator arrived on the ground floor in no time at all and opened its doors . Jin-Woo pulled his hood up and got out of the lift . Unlike when he was accompanied by Chairman Yu, no one seemed to recognise him now </p>
<p>Even those giving him cursory glances simply carried the looks of ‘Who could he be that he’s using the executives-only elevator?’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo paid them no mind and walked over to the exit . One of the waiting employees tasked with guiding people spotted Jin-Woo’s approach and opened the door for him to pass through </p>
<p>Jin-Woo continued on and crossed the lobby, but then, his steps came to a halt after he heard a voice coming from somewhere </p>
<p>[This is the latest update coming from Japan . ]. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s head shifted in the direction of that sound . A giant TV in the lobby that had been switched off earlier was now showing the real-time footage of the situation in Japan </p>
<p>It was the breaking news regarding the dungeon break and the massive calamity spreading at an alarming rate </p>
<p>Jin-Woo walked to the front of the TV </p>
<p>The sight of the ruined city captured from the TV station’s helicopter was truly gut-wrenching </p>
<p>The Giant monsters were demolishing the buildings . Those unfortunate citizens failing to evacuate in time were captured and immediately thrown into the mouths of these Giants . What little remained of armed forces poured out all their firepower but that proved to be a useless endeavour </p>
<p>It was still impossible to kill monsters without the powers of Hunters, after all </p>
<p>Although it was impossible to accurately calculate the death toll, the rough estimate had come out to well over a million </p>
<p>In a word, it was an unspeakable tragedy </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s expression hardened . This would be his first time seeing the current status with his own eyes . But then, that made sense </p>
<p>It was only yesterday that, after emerging from the dual dungeon, he asked Woo Jin-Cheol to take care of the aftermath and went back home to crash into a deep, deep slumber </p>
<p>He half-expected the worst, but the situation in Japan was far graver than his initial expectations . This whole thing reminded him of the nightmare unfolding on Jeju Island four years ago </p>
<p>Maybe one could claim that it was a silver lining among the storm of misfortunes . The dungeon break back then occurred on an island and the uniqueness of landscape meant that Korea was spared of the situation possibly becoming even worse than before </p>
<p>However, it was a different story for Japan </p>
<p>It was far too large to simply be called an island . A whole country was facing total destruction at this rate </p>
<p>Ba-thump, ba-thump, ba-thump!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s heart quickened as he watched those Giants </p>
<p>He was feeling rather displeased right now . When he thought about how such weaklings were stepping on humans like that, a powerful sense of disgust welled up from deep inside of him </p>
<p>But then… </p>
<p>‘Wait a sec… . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo quickly broke out of his reverie </p>
<p>What did he mean, such weaklings?. </p>
<p>He had never fought Giant-type monsters before . And he couldn’t sense its magic energy through a TV screen . So, why did he subconsciously think of the word ‘weakling’ almost right away when he saw a Giant monster?. </p>
<p>Was this coming from his self-confidence?. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo tilted his head this way and that, before shaking it altogether </p>
<p>‘Huh . Because my head’s so messy right now, I’m even beginning to think up some weird stuff, too . ’. </p>
<p>He turned around to leave </p>
<p>He managed to slip out of the cordon of people watching the broadcast with worried expressions, and quietly left the building </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The second day of the dungeon break </p>
<p>The attention of the entire world was focused on Japan . What was their plan of action against the dungeon break? Did Japan have any methods left to employ, anyway? If not, would America really step up to help them?. </p>
<p>And then…. </p>
<p>Was there a possibility that the Giants, having finished laying waste to Japan, would cross the ocean and start causing destruction in other countries, too?. </p>
<p>Worried gazes and ones filled with concern descended upon Japan as it continued to crumble </p>
<p>Of course, those nations that held an antagonistic relationship with Japan inwardly thought of different matters altogether, but outwardly at least, they sent over some token words of sympathy </p>
<p>Unfortunately, what the Japanese needed weren’t some words of comfort . No, they needed actual, physical help </p>
<p>They needed comprehensive power to rescue Japan from the monsters . Indeed, they needed the power capable of ‘saving’ them </p>
<p>As the announcement from the Americans was nowhere to be heard, the grim news of one-tenth of Japan already being destroyed became public . The plight of Japanese refugees filling up the highways continued to travel in the airwaves . They all abandoned their homes in order to survive and travelled to the east and west </p>
<p>However, just as it was the case with every nation on Earth, the landmass of Japan wasn’t infinite, to begin with . In the end, these people would eventually be pushed to a corner . The prophesied end was drawing near for them </p>
<p>And the world began asking more questions as it watched this pitiable sight unfold </p>
<p>– What is South Korea doing?. </p>
<p>– Why isn’t South Korea helping Japan?. </p>
<p>– Do they not know what owing someone means?. </p>
<p>The world remembered seeing the Jeju Island raid that took place only a few weeks ago </p>
<p>Japan had lost over half of their participating rank S Hunters for the sake of the Koreans . So, the world was asking, why were the Koreans only watching on the crisis unfolding in their neighbouring country and not doing anything to help?. </p>
<p>The scale of destruction and the death toll continued to be revised hourly . People grew outraged and grieved for the losses </p>
<p>As the feelings of sympathy grew larger and larger for the Japanese, the criticisms towards Korea grew harsher and harsher in turn </p>
<p>– Make a move already, South Korea!. </p>
<p>– Do they not know of the concept of loyalty?. </p>
<p>– Have the Koreans forgotten about Jeju Island?. </p>
<p>The mass media of the world was boiling over </p>
<p>And before long, another question rose up – the one about why Japan hadn’t requested South Korea with the subjugation of the monsters </p>
<p>And so, as the fourth day dawned on this tragedy… </p>
<p>The Association President Goh Gun-Hui, having decided that now was the right time, stepped in front of the crowd of reporters </p>
<p>Noisy, noisy… </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui swept his gaze over the tightly-packed wall of reporters as well as the cameras pointing at him and quietly opened his mouth to speak </p>
<p>“I express my condolences at the tragedy unfolding in Japan . And also, I’d like to reveal the position of South Korea’s own Hunter’s Association . ”. </p>
<p>And also… </p>
<p>A little earlier in the day, the American Hunter Bureau also released a statement, as well </p>
