<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 46</p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>Even after all of his progress, Jinwoo could not help but be wary of what was to come .  Still, his excitement in the anticipation of growth eclipsed his fear . </p>
<p>A moment ago, while he was looking for a suitable spot to start the quest, Jinwoo had used his phone to look through various video game wikis on classes . </p>
<p>[New skill . ]</p>
<p>[Growth benefits . ]</p>
<p>[Class-specific weapons . ]</p>
<p>[Class-only quests]</p>
<p>[ . Etc]</p>
<p>One thing was common across different video games: class advancement had many great benefits and rewards . </p>
<p>‘And it became possible for me at level forty . ’</p>
<p>Of course, not everything he found was positive .  There were forum posts here and there complaining:</p>
<p>[I’m worried that I picked the wrong class . ]</p>
<p>[F***, if I knew, I would’ve picked a different class . ]</p>
<p>[I messed up on my build . I think I’m done with this game . ]</p>
<p>[Do I have to delete my character?]</p>
<p> . Well, they were still talking about video games . </p>
<p>Jinwoo wasn’t that worried about what class he would pick .  He had solely used a dagger up until now, and even his skills were all related to an assassin class . </p>
<p>‘Dagger skills and something like ‘Stealth’ . ’</p>
<p>On top of that, his attributes were largely focused on strength and agility .  Because of this, Jinwoo couldn’t think of obtaining a class other than Assassin .  Thinking about the idea, Jinwoo summoned Casaka’s Poisoned Fang from his inventory . </p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>The dagger’s grip felt perfect in his hand .  He nodded to himself . </p>
<p>‘Yep, this is what I’m used to . ’</p>
<p>With the dagger in hand, Jinwoo moved his gaze towards the quest screen . </p>
<p>‘Well then…’</p>
<p>He began planning for as many possibilities as possible .  After taking a moment to prepare his heart, Jinwoo replied to the message . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Class Advancement Quest has arrived . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to accept? (Y/N)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Accept . ’</p>
<p>The moment he spoke the word in his mind, a messaged followed . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve accept the Class Advancement Quest . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>A Dungeon will be created for the quest . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘A Dungeon… will be created?’</p>
<p>Before he could fully grasp the meaning of the message, a change occurred in the space in front of him . </p>
<p>wooooong-</p>
<p>A tiny black hole appeared before his eyes, but that was just the start . </p>
<p>woo wooooong-</p>
<p>The hole that was as small as a bean grew to a size of a coin, then a volleyball, then finally became large enough for a man to enter . </p>
<p>‘This is…?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes were wide open .  After accepting the quest, he had expected another information screen with the quest’s information would follow but not this…</p>
<p>A Gate had formed before his eyes . </p>
<p>‘To think that it would even make a Gate…’</p>
<p>The phenomenon in front of him was exactly the same as the Gates that appeared in the world .  Only difference was that it was a bit smaller than the one he had seen . The System’s message continued, beckoning him in . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Please enter the Dungeon through the Gate . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Let’s be calm . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo calmed his heart . </p>
<p>Yes . </p>
<p>If he thought about it, whether he entered using a key or through a Gate, a Dungeon would be waiting on the other side .  He was just surprised at the creation of an artificial Gate in front of his eyes . While he had entered many Gates before, he had never seen one being created .  When he reached that line of thought, an idea appeared in his head,</p>
<p>‘Wait… Could other Hunters enter this Gate?’</p>
<p>Well, there was no time to experiment .  There weren’t any other Hunters in the vicinity, nor did he know of any Hunters that would come running if he . called… . </p>
<p>Jinwoo erased Yoo Jinho’s face from his mind and shook his head . </p>
<p>‘What would I do if something went wrong . ’</p>
<p>The System’s message blinked as if reminding him,</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Please enter the Dungeon through the Gate . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo was snapped back to reality by the electronic tone .  He slapped his cheeks to focus . </p>
<p>‘Now’s not the time to get distracted . ’</p>
<p>Success here would mean obtaining a class and other rewards .  He dreaded what failure would entail . He had to be focused . </p>
<p>“Whew-”</p>
<p>After a deep breath, Jinwoo held Casaka’s Poisoned Fang in a reverse grip and entered the Gate . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve entered the Dungeon . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>To be honest, he had entered the Gate with a great anticipation .  Contrary to his expectations, there was not much to be surprised at inside .  It was just a simple cave Dungeon . </p>
<p>“It’s the same as always…?”</p>
<p>He had heard that high-level Dungeons would connect to different types of interiors and expected something similar but was disappointed .  A special message did appear, however,</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>In this place, usage of potions and the shop is restricted, and leveling up will not restore your status . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo put away the dagger after confirming that there were no magic beasts around . </p>
<p>‘ . Looks like this won’t be easy . ’</p>
<p>Since this was a special Dungeon for class advancement, it seemed that there were a few conditions .  The fact that he could not heal himself through potions or level-ups was particularly troubling . </p>
<p>‘That means even small damage will accumulate over time . ’</p>
<p>An injury would spell the end here .  Without means of recovery, he would have to be cautious of every move he made . </p>
<p>‘I really, really have to be focused . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo closed the message box .  As he always did, he checked the exit of the Dungeon . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Until your class advancement is complete, you cannot leave . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The moment he placed his hand on the Gate, that message appeared .  He put his back into it, but the exit did not budge . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>He retracted his hand . </p>
<p>‘So the path to retreat is blocked . ’</p>
<p>He had yet to figure out the difficulty of the Dungeon .  Additionally, he could not recover his health here . Finally, there was no leaving until he was finished . </p>
<p>The risk this time was very high .  Even the bravest of Hunters would hesitate before entering with such conditions . </p>
<p>‘But a high risk doesn’t necessary mean that it’s bad . ’</p>
<p>High risk equaled high rewards .  He had learned as much from his experiences .  If all these conditions made the quest harder, perhaps an equally great reward waited at the end . </p>
<p>Well, there was only one way to find out . </p>
<p>‘Time to go . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo began to walk deeper into the cave .  He could not see the end of the tunnel and at the same time did not see or sense any magic beasts . </p>
<p>‘Wait, since this is the System’s territory, should it be “monsters” and not “magic beasts”?’</p>
<p>Eh, in the end, they were both dangerous beings . </p>
<p>There was one difference in this place compared to the normal cave Dungeons .  The cave’s walls were decorated with torches, placed evenly across the path . </p>
<p>‘Torches instead of glowing rocks . Hmm . ’</p>
<p>The torches were not an effective source of light .  Even if there were many of them, it was not enough to completely illuminate the dark tunnel .  As such, the flickering light produced many shadows here and there . The combination of the shadows and the silence produced a very dreary atmosphere compared to a normal Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘Well, I don’t have any problems seeing . ’</p>
<p>What bothered him was the impact it had on his mood . </p>
<p>Jinwoo went over and removed the closest torch from the wall .  The way forward became slightly brighter . </p>
<p>‘This is better . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled in satisfaction .  He took a brief look behind him, then started forward again, torch in hand . </p>
<p>How long did he walk in this straight path?</p>
<p>After some time, he finally came across a turn .  Around the corner, he felt several presences . </p>
<p>‘Finally . ’</p>
<p>He carefully dropped the torch on the ground . </p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>In the place of the torch, his right hand now held a dagger .  He briefly considered using ‘Stealth’ to gain a preemptive advantage but decided to conserve his mana; potions could not be used after all .  If he carelessly spent his mana, he might not be able to use a skill in a pivotal moment . </p>
<p>‘ . They’re coming this way . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo hugged the wall with his back, then waited for the enemies to come around the corner . </p>
<p>clang, clang</p>
<p>A metallic sound rang while they were walking towards him .  The sound came closer and closer . </p>
<p>clang, clang</p>
<p>At the rambunctious sound, Jinwoo wondered,</p>
<p>‘Are they holding some sort of a chain weapon?’</p>
<p>He was curious but did not worry .  He would find out in a moment . </p>
<p>‘5, 4, 3 . ’</p>
<p>He held his dagger in a reverse grip and held his breath .  He did not want the sound of his breathing to be heard . </p>
<p>‘2, 1 . ’</p>
<p>clang, clang . </p>
<p>Finally, their shadows appeared around the corner . </p>
<p>‘ . 0 . ’</p>
<p>As Jinwoo finished counting down, the thing showed itself .  Jinwoo immediately went for its neck . </p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The sound of metal striking metal rang loudly .  His dagger did not pierce the target . </p>
<p>‘Armor?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was surprised .  Confirming the identity of his enemy, he quickly backed way . </p>
<p>“Human?”</p>
<p>It was a knight equipped with a full set of armor .  Even its face was covered by a helmet . Just in case, Jinwoo called toward it,</p>
<p>“Oy!”</p>
<p>The knight reacted by charging toward Jinwoo . </p>
<p>clang, clang, clang!</p>
<p>The knight vigorously used his shoulders to try and tackle Jinwoo, but the Hunter easily twisted his body to dodge the attack .  The knight could not stop its momentum and ran forward for a bit before stopping . </p>
<p>‘Not human?’</p>
<p>After expanding his sense a bit more, Jinwoo was sure .  The knight did not have a heartbeat . It was a magic beast, or rather, a monster that he had never seen before .  To think that there’d be a monster covered from head to toe in armor . </p>
<p>‘So…’</p>
<p>It was almost as if he was fighting another human .  </p>
<p>shiing!</p>
<p>The knight turned around and unsheathe the sword at its side .  As Jinwoo thought, it had no intention of letting him leave alive .  Confirming each other’s hostility, Jinwoo’s eyes became a level sharper . </p>
<p>‘Sprint!’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your movement speed is increased by 40% .  </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The first to strike would be the victor!</p>
<p>Before the knight could reach him, Jinwoo entered its range first . </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<p>The Hunter dodged its panicked swing and stabbed its armor here and there . </p>
<p>Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>But he could not do any damage . </p>
<p>‘The armor’s too thick . ’</p>
<p>Not only that, it could almost be described as slippery .  His dagger helplessly slid off and was deflected everytime he struck the armor .  The knight swung its sword in a horizontal line . </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<p>Jinwoo lowered his head to dodge .  The blade of the sword passed just inches above his head .  As its attack was powerful, the opening created after missing was equally huge .  Jinwoo did not miss the opportunity . Still in melee range, Jinwoo focused all of his power into his dagger . </p>
<p>‘Vital Stab!’</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The dagger pierced through the armor . </p>
<p>‘Did it work?’</p>
<p>However, as if it didn’t do any damage, the knight ignored the dagger sticking out of its side and brought down the sword in a vertical line . </p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>Jinwoo threw his body backwards . </p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Sparks flew from the ground the sword struck . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo straightened himself after taking few steps back .  Casaka’s Poisoned Fang was still stuck to the knight’s side . </p>
<p>Che . </p>
<p>Jinwoo clicked his tongue . </p>
<p>‘He’s not exactly strong . ’</p>
<p>It was true .  Because of its armor, the knight was slow .  Not only that, its attack pattern was rather simple .  The primary obstacle was its tough resistance to bladed weapons . </p>
<p>Jinwoo rolled up his sleeves . </p>
<p>‘If it’s a tough armor a blade can’t get through, I’ve already got some experience . ’</p>
<p>His maintained his composure .  He recalled the scales of a boss that effortlessly broke a magic power infused steel sword .  He remembered how he took down that giant snake . </p>
<p>‘Compared to Casaka, this bastard’s nothing…’</p>
<p>Thinking of the first boss he ever won against, Jinwoo smiled in nostalgia . </p>
<p>clang, clang, clang!</p>
<p>The knight, confident in its armor, charged at Jinwoo once more . </p>
<p>‘As expected, it’s not that smart . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo easily dodged the knight’s shoulder tackle and maneuvered behind its back and put it in a headlock .  </p>
<p>craaack!</p>
<p>Of course, its neck was also armored; it probably would not be choked just by this . </p>
<p>craaaaaack!</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s arms flexed and showed their veins .  He was not trying to choke the knight . He clenched his teeth, and his eyes flared open . </p>
<p><strong>CRACK!</strong>.  . </p>
<p>With a sickening sound, the helmet was removed .  This was the power of the strength stat that had reached above 100 .  Having lost its head, the knight knelt to the ground . </p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated the Knight . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The welcoming sight of a message signaled the end of the fight .  While there was a light indicating a drop coming from the knight’s corpse, Jinwoo was focused on something else .  </p>
<p>‘What the, it’s empty?’</p>
<p>There was no head in the helmet he was holding .  He also looked inside the kneeling armor but found it just as empty . </p>
<p>‘Then was I fighting with a moving armor?’</p>
<p>As he reached that conclusion, two more knights appeared around the corner .  It appeared that they had finally realized that there was a fight going on . </p>
<p>clang, clang . </p>
<p>Having discovered Jinwoo, the two knights took out their swords in unison . </p>
<p>shiing-</p>
<p>shiing-</p>
<p>Jinwoo threw aside the helmet and stretched his neck and shoulders .  He knew the method of defeating them now . </p>
<p>‘Shall we begin?’</p>
<p>clang, clang, clang, clang!</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled at the approaching knights . </p>
<p>The quest was going smoothly so far . </p>
