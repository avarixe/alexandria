<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 19</p>
<p>Even as the bugs continuously bit and tore away at his defense, Hwang Dongseok calmly waited for the moment of opportunity .  He wanted to make sure the aggro was focused on him even when the Dealers began their counterattack . </p>
<p>‘This should be good enough!’</p>
<p>Now would begin the real hunt .  The bugs would learn why Hunters are called Hunters!</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok roared with strength,</p>
<p>“Deal!”</p>
<p>In response to the single word, the entire team’s firepower rained upon the bugs . </p>
<p>screech-!</p>
<p>screeeeeech-!</p>
<p>The cry of the magic beasts rang forth here and there .  As part of the Raid agreement, Jinwoo watched the party’s battle from the rear .  As he analyzed the battle, he imagined how he would fight against the bugs . </p>
<p>‘How frustrating…’</p>
<p>He suppressed the urge to step forward .  There were too many openings in the magic beasts; unfortunately, many of the Hunters seemed to miss those openings completely .  Yet, he was forced to stand in the back, doing nothing . It was frustrating . </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the damage to Hwang Dongseok’s team was minimal .  Their teamwork was that good . It appeared that the carefree attitude Hwang Dongseok maintained before the Raid was not for nothing . </p>
<p>“Jinseok, 11 o’clock!”</p>
<p>“Hyung, from the right, too!”</p>
<p>“Joontae, Sukmin, Gyuhwan! Take the right!”</p>
<p>“Yessir!”</p>
<p>“Cheoljin, your wrist is swelling .  Get to the rear!”</p>
<p>“Hwang hyung, I can handle this much!”</p>
<p>“You think we’ll be done after this? We don’t know how many more battles are waiting here, don’t go all out from the start! Control your pace!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, I got it!”</p>
<p>Having been through many battles together, even their conversations showed experience .  Proper communication in battle was the key to teamwork . Compared to the chaotic formations of the Association’s Hunters, these men were different . </p>
<p>‘Even he’s doing just fine . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked over to Yoo Jinho .  As a magic beast crashed into his shield, Jinho kicked away the bug and swung his sword .  The expensive blade cut straight through its head . Even as a mere D-rank Hunter, Jinho was putting up a good fight . </p>
<p>‘I guess the equipment’s covering for his lack of power and experience . ’</p>
<p>There was a reason why Hunters sought good equipment . </p>
<p>Meeting his eyes, Yoo Jinho made a thumbs-up at Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Relenting under Jinho’s bright and hopeful gaze, Jinwoo returned a thumbs-up back at the young man .  Yoo Jinho looked satisfied . </p>
<p>screeee-</p>
<p>Regardless, the battle was nearing its end .  As the rest of the party cleaned up the remaining magic beasts, Hwang Dongseok ordered his subordinates,</p>
<p>“Grab all the magic cores! We’ll be dividing it up exactly 9 ways . ”</p>
<p>“Yessir . ”</p>
<p>“This is my favorite part . ”</p>
<p>“Me too . ”</p>
<p>Watching his teammates work happily, Hwang Dongseok approached Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Oh boy, I gotta thank you for that . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who shouted the warning in the beginning, right? How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Just a… gut feeling . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo made up an explanation .  He could not say that it was due to his raised sense stat . </p>
<p>“Ah, is that so? A gut feeling .  You got some luck in ya . If we were just a step late in discovering them… phew-“</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of the Hunters who was going through the corpses gestured to Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>“Hwang hyung, come take a look at this . ”</p>
<p>His subordinates were gathered around something .  Hwang Dongseok headed towards them . </p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“There’s something off about these guys . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters parted to make room for Hwang Dongseok .  He sat down and looked over what they were pointing at .  There wasn’t anything wrong at a first glance; it was just dead bugs . </p>
<p>“What’s off about them?” </p>
<p>One of his subordinates pointed to the leg of one of the bugs .  Its end showed traces of being torn off messily . </p>
<p>“That wound, I don’t think it’s from us . ”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok’s forehead wrinkled .  After taking a closer look, he noted,</p>
<p>“Looks like… it was bitten off by something . ”</p>
<p>“Right? And this isn’t the only one .  Look, this one . And that one too . This one even had a wing ripped off .  I think they were like this before they fought us . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok’s face hardened .  Despite their numbers, it did feel like the magic beasts went down easier than expected . </p>
<p>“Were they… fighting each other before this?”</p>
<p>In that moment, it was very brief, but Jinwoo felt the 8 Hunters’ gaze fall on him .  When they saw that he was looking, they quickly turned back . With that, Jinwoo became sure . </p>
<p>‘As I thought…’</p>
<p>His first intuition was correct .  Their good teamwork was indicative of their long history together .  But how was it that they came this far without a Healer? No matter how good they were, people were prone to making mistakes from time to time .  Even just now, if it wasn’t for Jinwoo, their formation would’ve broken down at the sudden appearance of the bugs . </p>
<p>The pieces of the puzzle fell together in Jinwoo’s head, and a smile appeared on his lips . </p>
<p>‘I might be able to make use of them…’</p>
<p>As long as they moved according to his expectations . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok chuckled as he got up,</p>
<p>“Now, now .  Let’s keep going .  Looks like we won’t have any issues if it’s just this level . ”</p>
<p>His loud voice was not for the benefit of his teammates; they were right next to him, after all . </p>
<p>In the meantime, Yoo Jinho approached Jinwoo with a wide smile . </p>
<p>“Hyung, did you see that? You saw me, right? I just wooshed! And bam! All these magic beasts-“</p>
<p>He swung his sword around with a flourish . </p>
<p>Jinwoo ask him,</p>
<p>“Your sword and shield, they’re quite expensive, right?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, yeah .  My father took special care on me when he heard that I was going on my first Raid . ”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to be careful, too, then . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo patted Yoo Jinho’s back, then headed after the other Hunters . </p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>With a confused look, Yoo Jinho followed after him . </p>
<p>The party traveled deeper into the cave but did not come across any more magic beasts .  As a Dungeon with a long single path, it couldn’t have been that they had went around any . </p>
<p>“Were the ones at the entrance it?”</p>
<p>“Nah, there’s no way . ”</p>
<p>“How strange . ”</p>
<p>“There should at least be a boss, right?”</p>
<p>“You think a Gate would open up with no boss in it?”</p>
<p>The Hunters exchanged different opinions back and forth as they walked through the large but empty Dungeon . </p>
<p>“Hold up . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok stopped the party .  At his sudden action, few people bumped into each other as they stopped .  The Hunter who smacked his face into Hwang Dongseok’s back asked as he rubbed his nose,</p>
<p>“Ow, Hwang hyung, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Gyuhwan, shine your light here . ”</p>
<p>Jo Gyuhwan moved his ball of light from their rear to the area where Hwang Dongseok was indicating . </p>
<p>“Holy shit…”</p>
<p>“They’re all…”</p>
<p>The Hunters let out quiet groans . </p>
<p>Insect wings, legs, bodies and even heads were littered across the ground .  Corpses of the bug type magic beasts were everywhere . The dead bodies piled up more and more deeper into the cave, and at the end of the tunnel:</p>
<p>“It’s the boss room . ”</p>
<p>Someone uttered .  Hwang Dongseok nodded in agreement . </p>
<p>“Everyone, gears out . ”</p>
<p>They responded immediately, faces filled with nervousness .  The party quietly sneaked towards the boss room, with Hwang Dongseok at the vanguard .  Suddenly, the man who had bumped into Hwang Dongseok exclaimed,</p>
<p>“Holy- holy shit!”</p>
<p>It was the height of stupidity to make loud noises in a Dungeon; it would only serve to attract magic beasts that could’ve been avoided .  But nobody rebuked the Hunter who had shouted . </p>
<p>“Whoa-“</p>
<p>“How much would all this be?”</p>
<p>“This is a big score!”</p>
<p>They were all exclaiming in admiration . </p>
<p>“Hold . ”</p>
<p>As Jo Gyuhwan’s light lit up the area from above, what the Hunters had discovered in the room became clearer .  A large amount of jewel like rocks were embedded on the walls . </p>
<p>“It’s mana crystals![1]”</p>
<p>“The entire wall is filled with them!”</p>
<p>The Hunters’ eyes sparkled brighter than the light reflecting off the mana crystals . </p>
<p>Mana crystals!</p>
<p>It was one of the treasures that could be found in Dungeons .  Although they contained less magic power than the magic cores from magic beasts, they were normally found in large amounts .  Mining them would result in an impressive income for a raiding party . The amount that the party had come across was even more impressive; the entire wall was filled to the brim with crystals . </p>
<p>“By my rough estimates…”</p>
<p>One of the Hunters, quick with his calculations, started counting the crystals . </p>
<p>“If we got all of it out, it’d be roughly 1 billion .  If we divided it by 9 shares, each person could walk away with over a 100 million . ”</p>
<p>A big smile appeared on the Hunters listening .  Suddenly, Yoo Jinho, who was standing next to Jinwoo, poked Jinwoo’s sides with his elbows . </p>
<p>“Hyung, give me your contract for a second . ”</p>
<p>“The contract? What for?”</p>
<p>“Just trust me, I’m pretty good with these kinds of things . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo shrugged and handed his contract over .  Yoo Jinho took it and walked over to Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>“Excuse me, sunbae-nims[2], I have something I want to say . ”</p>
<p>He unfolded and held out the contract for all to see . </p>
<p>“Leader, this is Jinwoo hyung’s contract .  As you can see, there’s nothing in here about being excluded from mana crystals, only mana cores . ”</p>
<p>Everyone understood what Yoo Jinho was trying to say .  It was standard agreement that income from treasures and artifacts would be divided evenly across all members of the raiding party .  This was different than magic cores only going to those who took down the magic beasts . As such, the mana crystals should be divided up 10 ways, not 9 . </p>
<p>The look in the other Hunters’ faces changed, but Hwang Dongseok stepped in front of them with a smile . </p>
<p>“Of course, we’ll divide it up across all of us .  I know this . But there’s something we have to take care of first . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok pointed forward with his finger .  Yoo Jinho got startled for a second; he thought the man was pointing at him .  But turning around, he saw a giant spider resting in a faraway corner . </p>
<p>“Whoa…!”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho started walking backwards after discovering the creature and covered his mouth .  Thankfully, the spider did not move; it appeared to be sleeping . The lifeless husks of bugs littered its surroundings .  The half-eaten corpses reminded the Hunters of leftover food sitting at the bottom of a garbage can . </p>
<p>“It’s the boss . ”</p>
<p>“Was it the one that ate all those bugs?”</p>
<p>“He sure had a feast . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok gathered the Hunters, including Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho . </p>
<p>“As you’re all aware, if the boss goes down, the Gate will start closing .  So why don’t we mine all the mana crystals before we take the spider down?”</p>
<p>They all nodded in agreement . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok turned to a bald Hunter . </p>
<p>“Cheoljin, did you grab the gear?”</p>
<p>Lee Cheoljin shook his head . </p>
<p>“No .  Who would’ve thought to find mana crystals in a C-rank Dungeon? I left all the mining gear back in the car . ”</p>
<p>“You punk… Didn’t I tell you to be prepared at all times?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry . Really sorry . ”</p>
<p>Lee Cheoljin apologized to everyone with a smile . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok scratched his head and spoke,</p>
<p>“Sigh, this is going to be a hassle .  Can you two stay here while we go grab the equipment?”</p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “mana crystals” (마나석): “mana” in english + “stone/rock” 석 .  Stylized the translation into “crystals” because of their shininess . </p>
<p>[2]: “sunbae-nim” (선배님): “sunbae” is a Korean word used to address one’s seniors in the same profession .  In rare cases where someone younger than you was at the company longer than you were, that person would still be your “sunbae” .  “Nim” is added with respect occasionally . Japanese equivalent = senpai . </p>
