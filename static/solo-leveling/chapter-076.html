<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 76</p>
<p>‘Wait, what’s going on…?’</p>
<p>Just what was happening? Jung Gisoo ended the call with Baek Yoonho and tilted his head .  It was amusing enough that an E-rank Hunter was here for a retest, and now, Baekho’s Guildmaster was coming here to learn that Hunter’s results . </p>
<p>‘Is he the real deal?’</p>
<p>If the Baek Yoonho was being this serious, perhaps there was something really going on? But the deputy quickly shook his head . </p>
<p>‘Eh, no way . ’</p>
<p>The Awakening after Awakening was not a phenomenon you saw every day . </p>
<p>Was it few months ago? The entire Association was thrown into chaos when a potential Reawakening candidate appeared, but nothing came out of it .  The confirmed cases of the phenomenon were incredibly few, but there were a lot of mistaken cases . </p>
<p>‘Plenty of deluded people came here for a retest and wasted our resources . ’</p>
<p>Baekho must’ve been thoroughly mistaken about something .  Still, thinking about maintaining a good relationship with Baekho, Jung Gisso could not refuse Baek Yoonho’s request . </p>
<p>“I’m heading out . I’ll be right back . ”</p>
<p>“Huh? Where are you headed, deputy?”</p>
<p>“I just remembered I have something to do in Building B . ”</p>
<p>Building B was the occupational language used in the Association for the building with the magic power measuring equipment .  It was where the evaluation of the Hunters’ rankings occurred in . </p>
<p>“Alright, understood . ”</p>
<p>“Call me if anything happens . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . ”</p>
<p>Even as he kept thinking “Reawakening my ass…” in his head, Jung Gisoo imagined Baek Yoonho’s face and headed toward Building B . </p>
<p>Jinwoo sat down on a chair at the end of the waiting room .  There were three others waiting for their testing . Their faces were filled with nervousness; Jinwoo fully understood their feelings . </p>
<p>‘After all, the results of the test will determine the course of their lives . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was the same the first time he waited in this place .  He recalled how he had hoped to become a high-ranker back then .  The young man four years ago dreamt about B-rank, A-rank and even deluded himself as far as becoming an S-ranker .  Receiving his E-rank shocked him and destroyed his dreams . Remembering that day four years ago, Jinwoo smiled in nostalgia . </p>
<p>‘Why is he smiling?’</p>
<p>‘How could you smile at a time like this?’</p>
<p>The others waiting stared at Jinwoo strangely, but the man remained carefree . </p>
<p>‘Was he born with a strong heart?’</p>
<p>‘He doesn’t look nervous at all . ’</p>
<p>The spirits of the others were lowered by Jinwoo’s confident attitude .  They turned their heads and looked at each other . </p>
<p>‘Looks like nothing changed . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo also remembered this .  Waiting here filled you with nervousness, and people would look at each other, interested in the other’s results .  Still smiling, Jinwoo looked around the building . Just like the people, the building itself had not changed . Since the Hunter Association was only ten years old, the building looked relatively new .  The interiors were as he remembered . However, one thing was different,</p>
<p>‘Those people over there . ’</p>
<p>As Jinwoo stared at the group of well dressed men and women across the room, the man next to him struck up a conversation,</p>
<p>“They’re all from various Guilds . ”</p>
<p>“Guilds?”</p>
<p>“Yeah . Hunters don’t exactly go looking for small Guilds to join . So instead, they send representatives here to try and recruit the fresh rankers . ”</p>
<p>It did look like the people in the group were giving off a cold vibe to each other . </p>
<p>‘And the way that they’re looking at us with anticipation . ’</p>
<p>It now made sense . </p>
<p>“Just in case you don’t know, you shouldn’t join those Guilds . ”</p>
<p>“Why’s that?”</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard, small Guilds engage in dangerous Raids and lose a lot of Hunters . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded .  That made sense .  The small Guilds were probably not in a good position .  Raiding low-level Dungeons like private parties wouldn’t result in a good income, and at the same time, they did not have enough power to properly raid high-level Dungeons .  Because of that, small Guilds’ affairs often resulted in incidents . </p>
<p>‘So refreshing their member count is very important to them . ’</p>
<p>And that resulted in these small Guilds coming to the Association’s building for recruitment . </p>
<p>“Ah . ”</p>
<p>The man who struck up a conversation wiped away the sweat gathering at his brows with a handkerchief .  The man carefully held out a hand to Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“Since we met in a place like this, shall we introduce ourselves? My name is Yoon Junghoon . ”</p>
<p>“I’m Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>With a short greeting, the two men returned to waiting in silence . </p>
<p>“Next person . ”</p>
<p>The measuring room was wide open, so people were able see the expressions of the employees and the tested person .  The person who just got tested did not look good . </p>
<p>‘Must be E or D . ’</p>
<p>As if reaching the same conclusion as Jinwoo, the people from the Guilds did not show any interest .  It was a rather honest reaction . Jinwoo wondered if they had a way of knowing the exact results somehow . </p>
<p>“Next person . ”</p>
<p>Another result came out .  It seemed like this one was also a dud .  The man walked out with heavy footsteps . Well, it made sense . </p>
<p>‘If high-rankers came out that often, they wouldn’t be so revered . ’</p>
<p>For the average person, even receiving a C-rank was a great thing .  They could earn a lot through a private party, and if they were lucky, they could even enter a large Guild .  Even Baekho’s new recruits had four C-rank members . If you succeeded in entering a large Guild, you’ll earn an income comparable to a doctor or a lawyer .  The man next to Jinwoo struck up a conversation again,</p>
<p>“I heard that the signing bonus for large Guilds are incredible . ”</p>
<p>The man’s hand holding the handkerchief was lightly trembling . </p>
<p>“To be honest, I actually in a bit of debt . Have to live away from my daughter, you see . All this is making me more anxious . ”</p>
<p>The man realized he was speaking a little too freely .  He quickly lowered his head to Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“Sorry, what am I saying to a stranger . how embarrassing . I get a little talkative when I’m nervous . ”</p>
<p>“It’s alright . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled and also bowed his head .  Another Awakened Being left the testing room . </p>
<p>“Next person, please . ”</p>
<p>It was the man’s turn .  However, the sweating man suddenly held and shook Jinwoo’s sleeves .  Was he sick?</p>
<p>“Are you feeling alright?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo asked out of concern .  The man shook his head . </p>
<p>“No, nothing like that… Er… Do you mind going first? I’m feeling too nervous right now . ”</p>
<p>The man’s eyes were pleading .  Well, if he was going to give up his spot, Jinwoo had no reasons to refuse .  Jinwoo happily agreed . He understood the man’s feelings; after all, the few minutes in that room would determine the fate of your life .  Anyone would be shaking . </p>
<p>Jinwoo got up instead of the man and headed to the employee .  The employee asked with a business tone,</p>
<p>“Name?”</p>
<p>“Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>“Sung Jinwoo-ssi… Alright, place your hand on that black surface and wait . ”</p>
<p>As instructed, Jinwoo walked up to the measuring device and placed a hand on the black surface . </p>
<p>‘Huh? He was already tested as an E-ranker?’</p>
<p>The employee looked at Jinwoo’s file and was amused .  Almost every single Hunter that came here for a retest were these pathetic E-rankers .  The employee looked derisively at Jinwoo then turned on the measuring device . </p>
<p>beep</p>
<p>woooong-</p>
<p>The machine made a noise for a moment, then completed its measurement .  The results were displayed on the monitor . </p>
<p>‘Huh? What the hell?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo removed the hand, and the employee spoke to him in confusion,</p>
<p>“Hold on . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to do it again . ”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo put his palm on the machine again . </p>
<p>beep</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>This had never happened before .  The employee’s expression darkened .  Of all the days the measuring device could be acting up… The employee apologetically spoke to Jinwoo again,</p>
<p>“Sorry . Just one more time . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>At the repeated instruction, Jinwoo just placed a hand on the machine and kept it there . </p>
<p>beep beeeeeep</p>
<p>‘Why is it like this?’</p>
<p>The employee began to sweat .  The people gathered outside realized something was wrong . </p>
<p>‘What is it? Did something happen?’</p>
<p>‘How many times is that man going to run the measuring device?’</p>
<p>‘Looks like something went wrong . ’</p>
<p>Feeling the attention on him, the employee began to sweat profusely . </p>
<p>beep </p>
<p>‘Dammit, what am I supposed to do?’</p>
<p>While the employee stood still in panic,</p>
<p>“What the? Where did Changshik go? Why are you here alone?”</p>
<p>The employee turned around .  The Deputy of the Reception Office, Jung Gisoo was standing behind him . </p>
<p>“Deputy Jung!”</p>
<p>At the appearance of an unexpected ally, the employee’s face relaxed a bit . </p>
<p>“Sunbae went on a bathroom break . ”</p>
<p>“Does that bastard know what the time is? To think that he would leave his spot like that…”</p>
<p>Jung Gisoo could not continue . </p>
<p>‘ . Well, I also left my post . ’</p>
<p>Anyways, it was a good thing that he had come here .  With the senior employee missing, this unlucky newbie was sweating profusely .  This was the time for a veteran to step-up . </p>
<p>“So what is it? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Jung Gisoo showed interest at whatever was happening . </p>
<p>“There’s something wrong with the machine . ”</p>
<p>“The measuring device?”</p>
<p>“Here, look . The results keep showing an error . ”</p>
<p>The employee stepped aside and showed Jung Gisoo the monitor showing the measurement results .  The deputy’s face froze . </p>
<p>“ . How long have you been working here?”</p>
<p>“About six months . Did I do something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No . Call Changshik and tell him to come right away . ”</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>“Now’s not the time for bathroom breaks, call him!”</p>
<p>Jung Gisoo raised his voice .  The employee flinched and asked,</p>
<p>“W-what’s going on, deputy?”</p>
<p>“This is not an error! It’s saying ‘measurement impossible’! Don’t you know what that means?!”</p>
<p>“Eh? It’s not just an error message?”</p>
<p>Why were all the new hires so useless? Jung Gisoo moved his gaze from the employee to the person being measured . </p>
<p>‘How could this be…’</p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo .  The man whose results interested Baekho’s Guildmaster .  </p>
<p>Jung Gisoo kept his eyes on Sung Jinwoo and spoke to the employee,</p>
<p>“You moron, it means that our devices are incapable of measuring that man’s magic power . ”</p>
<p>“Sir? Does-does that mean?”</p>
<p>He said he worked here for six months? Forget six months, this had not happened in the past two years .  Of course the new hire wouldn’t know . Jung Gisoo replied with a shaking voice,</p>
<p>“Yes… He’s an S-ranker . ”</p>
<p>S-rank .  Because of its widespread use to denote certain people’s rankings, it’s often mistaken as an official power level .  In reality, the S-rank was given to people whose powers could not be measured by the limits of humanity’s measuring technology . </p>
<p>“So hurry up and call over Changshik . ”</p>
<p>“I’ll call him right away . ”</p>
<p>Soon, Kim Changshik ran over while pulling up his pants . </p>
<p>“pant, pant . Let me see . ”</p>
<p>Confirming the information on the monitor, Kim Changshik’s face turned white .  His eyes were shaking as they moved over to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘This man is Korea’s tenth…’ [1]</p>
<p>Kim Changshik approached Jinwoo .  The Hunter finally took his hand off of the measuring device . </p>
<p>“Er… With our current machine, Sung Jinwoo-ssi,”</p>
<p>Kim Changshik realized who this man would become and quickly changed his tone,</p>
<p>“No, Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim, it is impossible to measure your magic power . In order to use our more accurate measuring device, we’ll have to obtain the upper management’s permission . Do you mind coming back to the Association in three days?”</p>
<p>Kim Changshik had spoken as mandated by his training .  It had been such a long time since he had to read that script memorized in his head .  He barely remembered the correct phrases . </p>
<p>As a man with knowledge about Hunters, Jinwoo understood what that meant . </p>
<p>‘Alright . ’</p>
<p>A deferred measurement evaluation .  In other words, if this more accurate measurement device was also unable to measure him, it would mean that he would become an S-ranker . </p>
<p>‘Thank god . ’</p>
<p>If he received an A-rank just now, he would have to return to the Association after becoming stronger .  But what would they think if he “Awakened” once more after Reawakening? The Reawakening itself was an incredibly rare occurrence, but a third Awakening would raise a ton of suspicion .  Jinwoo was glad he did not need to be bothered by such attention . </p>
<p>‘Phew-’</p>
<p>With the satisfying result, Jinwoo sighed in relief .  As he turned to leave,</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Every single pair of eyes in the building was focused on him . </p>
<p>“Oh my, you’re a busy man . You didn’t have to come here yourself like this . ”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, I’m here to meet the Hunter Association’s Director Park . How could I just give you a call? I had to come see you face to face . ”</p>
<p>As Choi Jongin smiled with his eyes and spoke with friendliness, the elderly Director Park chuckled in response . </p>
<p>Who was this man in front of him? He was the man who led South Korea’s top Guild, “Hunters” . </p>
<p>The Strongest Soldier, Choi Jongin .  The man’s words could move the country’s most powerful raiding party .  And that man was showing consideration for the elderly director, how could he not feel happy?</p>
<p>Choi Jongin placed a cigarette in his mouth,</p>
<p>“Is it okay if I smoke?”</p>
<p>“Of course . ”</p>
<p>“What about you, director?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, I’m good . ”</p>
<p>With a lit cigarette, Choi Jongin was the fitting image of a carefree young man who had everything in life . </p>
<p>‘Is this what they call charisma?’</p>
<p>While the director stared at him, Choi Jongin asked,</p>
<p>“You know, Building B’s rather loud today . ”</p>
<p>“Building B?”</p>
<p>The director looked in the direction of the building .  In reality, the director could not have heard what was happening .  However, Choi Jongin was an S-rank Hunter . The man’s five senses were incomparable to an ordinary person .  If that man was saying it was loud, something must be happening over there . A valuable guest was here, how embarrassing .  The director furrowed his brows and spoke,</p>
<p>“I’ll go check it out . ”</p>
<p>“No, it’s alright . ”</p>
<p>Choi Jongin dropped the cigarette and put it out with a foot . </p>
<p>“I’m also curious on what’s going on over there . ”</p>
<p>Raising his head, Choi Jongin’s eyes were filled with light, and a smile appeared on his face,</p>
<p>“Let’s go together . ”</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: I have to correct a mistake I made earlier . In chapter 59, I translated that Baek Yoonho only knew 10 S-rankers born in Korea . Looking back on the original passage, the man’s thoughts are more closely translated as “I only know of 10-ish S-rankers currently IN Korea”, not born . This could’ve meant that there were non-Korean S-rankers currently at the time in Korea for whatever reason (never confirmed) . Still, I was wrong, our MC Sung Jinwoo is the 10th S-ranker born in Korea . </p>
