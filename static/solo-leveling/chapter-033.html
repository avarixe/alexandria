<h1>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 33</h1> <p>Having focused on the clash of daggers, Kang Taeshik was caught off guard by the sudden surge of pain shooting from his foot and backed off </p>
<p>Jinwoo did not give the man any room to breathe </p>
<p>‘<strong>Sprint</strong>!’. </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Sprint has been activated . </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Your movement speed is increased by 30% .   While active, 1 mana will be used up every minute . </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>As Jinwoo rapidly chased after the man, Kang Taeshik was surprised once more </p>
<p>‘He got faster!’. </p>
<p>Up until now, he had felt that his speed was matched by Jinwoo’s; maybe he was just a smidgen faster .  But seeing Jinwoo suddenly speed up a level, Kang Taeshik could not afford to lose a moment of focus . Jinwoo closed the gap in an instant and stabbed his dagger into Kang Taeshik’s thigh .  . </p>
<p>“Argh!”. </p>
<p>It was an attack that slipped past Kang Taeshik’s defense that had been focused on his upper body </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Paralysis has been inflicted . </td> </tr> <tr> <td>The target’s resistance was too high .  Effect cancelled . </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Bleeding has been inflicted . </td> </tr> <tr> <td>The target will lose 1% health per second . </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>‘Good enough!’. </p>
<p>One of Casaka’s Poisoned Fang’s special effects went through .  It was a shame that it wasn’t ‘Paralysis’, but ‘Bleeding’ would still make the fight much easier </p>
<p>But Kang Taeshik held his pride as a high-ranking Hunter!. </p>
<p>His resistance was not at all low .  He leaped after Jinwoo with his knife </p>
<p>slash- slash-</p>
<p>Jinwoo dodged the knife by a hair’s breadth and counterattacked towards Kang Taeshik’s vitals .  Even with a wound on his thigh, the man skillfully blocked Jinwoo’s attacks </p>
<p>clang, clang!</p>
<p>Both of the fighter’s brows moistened with sweat </p>
<p>‘The speed is about even!’. </p>
<p>‘Our speed’s the same!’. </p>
<p>The two men praised the other’s speed and continued their ultra short-range battle of speed .  A single misstep would mean defeat; the duo mercilessly attacked each other with attacks meant to kill </p>
<p>slash, slash, slaaaash, slash- slash!</p>
<p>A spectacle that would drain the blood of those watching, it was truly a fight to the death </p>
<p>‘I have to break the balance . ’. </p>
<p>Jinwoo focused strength into his eyes </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Bloodlust has been activated . </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Kang Taeshik looked into Jinwoo’s eyes and flinched </p>
<p>‘What?’. </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Fear has been inflicted . </td> </tr> <tr> <td>The target will lose 50% of all attributes for 1 minute . </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>‘It worked!’. </p>
<p>Jinwoo became assured of victory .  On the other hand, Kang Taeshik’s eyes were trembling </p>
<p>‘What’s happening to me?’. </p>
<p>After meeting Jinwoo’s eyes, it suddenly felt like he had been submerged in deep water .  His body felt heavy, as if he was struggling to move underwater . The speed that he was so proud of was cut drastically </p>
<p>slash! slaash!</p>
<p>The stalemate had been broken .  Jinwoo’s attacks began to land . One by one, wounds started appearing on Kang Taeshik’s body </p>
<p>‘This, this can’t be!’. </p>
<p>The B-rank Hunter was in panic .  This was definitely an effect of a debuff skill .  He had never heard of an Assassin-class that could use a debuff magic </p>
<p>‘Is he not an Assassin-class?’. </p>
<p>But if not, how was his speed possible?. </p>
<p>Kang Taeshik could not finish his thought .  His panic quickly turned into terror . Jinwoo was charging straight at him from the front .  Kang Taeshik swung his knife at Jinwoo’s eyes with all of his speed as a final resort </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly twisted his head but was scratched by the knife on his cheek .  But this amount of damage was in his calculations . He had thrown his entire body into the deciding blow, anticipating to dodge the desperate counterattack </p>
<p>The two men had fought in a world where time had slowed down .  In their final infinitesimal moment, Kang Taeshik frowned in realization </p>
<p>‘Shit . ’. </p>
<p>stab . </p>
<p>Casaka’s Poisoned Fang dug itself deep into Kang Taeshik’s chest </p>
<p>“cough!”. </p>
<p>Kang Taeshik widened his eyes in pain .  In that moment, the two men knew it was over; the victor had been decided .  Blood seeped out of the corner of Kang Taeshik’s mouth . He smiled with a blood-filled mouth .  Of all the days, he just had to meet a Reawakened Hunter in a D-rank Dungeon today </p>
<p>‘I really have shitty luck…’. </p>
<p>The knife in his hand fell to the ground .  As he gasped for breath, Kang Taeshik whispered something into Jinwoo’s ear </p>
<p>“…”. </p>
<p>Jinwoo allowed the man his final words, then removed the dagger from his chest </p>
<p>Kang Taeshik’s body slumped to the ground, like a puppet with its strings cut </p>
<p>collapse</p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>You’ve completed the ‘Emergency Quest: Deal With The Enemies’</td> </tr> <tr> <td>The reward for completing the quest has arrived . </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Would you like to verify? (Y/N)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Jinwoo grimaced at the message .  Like before, killing a human being left a bitter taste in his mouth, even if the opponent had instigated it .  If not for the reward, this affair would’ve been a red in his ledger . Jinwoo tried to comfort himself with that thought and checked the reward </p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>You’ve received the below reward . </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Reward 1 . Stat points +5</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>‘What?’. </p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the reward incredulously .  It was much smaller than what he had received for dealing with Hwang Dongseok’s party </p>
<p>‘The difficulty this time was much higher!’. </p>
<p>Did the number of enemies matter more than their skill? Or was there some other factor involved?. </p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head in question, then, something caught his eyes behind the screen .  There was a dime-sized light coming from Kang Taeshik’s corpse . Jinwoo’s eyes widened,. </p>
<p>‘Is it…?’. </p>
<p>He could not believe it, but it was the same light coming from monsters’ corpses with drops .  The same light also appeared in magic beasts’ corpses with magic cores . And now, the light that signified a drop was coming from Kang Taeshik </p>
<p>‘What could it be?’. </p>
<p>He calmed his beating heart and stretched a hand toward Kang Taeshik’s corpse </p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<p>He was not mistaken!. </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>You’ve found a “Runestone: Stealth”</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Would you like to acquire it?</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>‘Runestone? Wait, Runestone?!!!’. </p>
<p>His heart started pounding again in excitement .  The skill that Kang Taeshik used had been left behind as a Runestone on his corpse .  ‘Stealth’ was a rare skill that only a handful of Hunters had . If Jinwoo was able to obtain a Runestone with that skill…. </p>
<p>‘Acquire . ’. </p>
<p>A small stone with runes inscribed on it appeared in his outstretched hand </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Runestone: Stealth</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Break the Runestone to absorb the skill . </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>He had to break the stone to absorb the skill .  This confirmed that this was truly a Runestone . Breaking this would give him access to ‘Stealth’ .  Jinwoo had never heard of a Runestone granting ‘Stealth’, that alone made the item priceless </p>
<p>Two people’s voice cried out from behind him </p>
<p>“Sung-ssi, are you alright?”. </p>
<p>“Jinwoo-ssi!”. </p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly hid the Runestone in his pockets and turned around .  Song Chiyeol and Lee Juhee was staring at him in disbelief . To think that an E-rank Hunter Jinwoo, who used to tremble in fear in D-rank Dungeons, defeated the B-rank Hunter Kang Taeshik .  The noncombat-class Lee Juhee might not fully grasp the situation, but the C-rank Song Chiyeol understood just how unbelievable this was </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked over his body </p>
<p>“Yes, I’m alright . ”. </p>
<p>At a glance, everything seemed to be alright .  There wasn’t any specific place that was hurting .  But as he turned his head, the blood that had pooled beneath his chin dripped to the ground .  Jinwoo touched his cheek; the cut that he received during his final attack was bleeding </p>
<p>“Ah . ”. </p>
<p>“I’ll heal it . ”. </p>
<p>A blue light gathered in Juhee’s hands, and even that small wound quickly disappeared .  The E-rank Hunter had defeated the B-ranker without any major injury . To the two that knew Jinwoo, this was more shocking than the fact that a B-ranker had tried to kill them all </p>
<p>“Young man, how did you…”. </p>
<p>Song Chiyeol could not finish his sentence .  Jinwoo knew what he wanted to say, so he opened his mouth instead,. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry . I’ll be able to tell you the full story someday, but right now, please don’t ask me any questions . ”. </p>
<p>As Jinwoo asked with a stern and sincere voice, Juhee nodded her head .  Song Chiyeol hesitated, then nodded as well,. </p>
<p>“If you say it like that, I’m sure you have a good reason . I understand . ”. </p>
<p>Then, Jinwoo turned his head towards the direction of the boss room .  They had hit a bump on the road, but he wanted to complete his original objective .  However, he had to send the other two away . He wanted to solo the boss, and there was something he wanted to do without the others watching </p>
<p>Jinwoo asked Song Chiyeol,. </p>
<p>“I’m sure continuing the Raid after all this is too much for the two of you . Why don’t you leave the Dungeon and contact the Association? I’ll stay behind and see if there are other survivors . ”. </p>
<p>Song Chiyeol intuitively understood what Jinwoo was asking for </p>
<p>‘He’s going to close the Gate . ’. </p>
<p>“That sounds good, Ms . Juhee, why don’t we leave . ”. </p>
<p>Juhee hesitated, then ran over to Jinwoo,. </p>
<p>“You didn’t forget our dinner promise, right?”. </p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled,. </p>
<p>“Of course not . I still have to get that change . ”. </p>
<p>“Then don’t forget . I’ll be waiting outside . ”. </p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded, and Juhee, satisfied, left with Song Chiyeol .  But even as she walked out of the Dungeon, she repeatedly looked back .  . </p>
<p>Confirming the two had left, Jinwoo sighed </p>
<p>“Sigh . ”. </p>
<p>He had hoped to hide his abilities for a bit longer .  But now that there were two more witnesses, he could not delay it much longer </p>
<p>‘It’s not like I want to threaten Juhee or Song-ssi ahjussi . ’. </p>
<p>Killing the B-rank Hunter would be ruled as an act of self-defense .  Since he had two witnesses, there would be no problem . The problem was explaining how an E-rank Hunter had defeated a B-rank Hunter </p>
<p>‘Best explanation is that I went through Reawakening…’. </p>
<p>And so, he decided to go with that route .  He would claim that he was a Reawakened Hunter and undergo the retest .  Nobody would believe the truth about the System or level-ups, and he didn’t particularly want to reveal that detail </p>
<p>Having determined that he would undergo a retest, Jinwoo felt a slight sense of disappointment </p>
<p>‘I planned to do it after getting just a bit stronger…’. </p>
<p>But sometimes, things just did not go according to plan .  There was nothing he could do </p>
<p>‘Wonder what my new rank will be?’. </p>
<p>He felt evenly matched with Kang Taeshik, so perhaps he was a little above B-rank?. </p>
<p>Jinwoo had thought that he had become stronger, but the increases in strength from B-rank to S-rank Hunters were beyond his expectations </p>
<p>‘Well, I’ll worry about that later . ’. </p>
<p>Right now, he had to focus on the boss .  The D-rank Dungeon had only shown E-rank magic beasts so far, this meant that the magic power that was detected when measuring the Dungeon’s difficulty mostly came from the boss .  If that was the case, he could probably earn some experience points still </p>
<p>‘Before that . ’. </p>
<p>There was something he had to check .  He focused his energies and expanded the range of his senses </p>
<p>“Found him . ”. </p>
<p>Jinwoo started walking .  On the way, he found the corpses of Kim Sangshik and the other Hunter[1] .  This was the power of a high-ranking Hunter . If they wanted, it was nothing for them to quickly dispatch a lower-ranking Hunter </p>
<p>Jinwoo passed the bodies of his former comrades with a hardened expression </p>
