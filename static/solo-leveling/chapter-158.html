<h3>Chapter 158: Chapter 158</h3> <p>He didn’t even have enough time to get surprised </p>
<p>The angel statue suddenly began its attack . A large, tightly-clenched fist came flying at him like a flash of light </p>
<p>The attack was coming from too close a distance and its speed was also too fast to evade cleanly – that’s what his brain, trained to near-perfection through countless battles, had told him </p>
<p>Jin-Woo urgently raised his arms to block the attack . It was not an incorrect decision to make, but that didn’t mean it was the correct one, either </p>
<p>SLAM-!!. </p>
<p>The power behind that punch was so incredulous that both his legs momentarily became airborne as he flew to the wall on the far side before ungainly crashing into it </p>
<p>Crack-!!. </p>
<p>The debris from the broken wall tumbled down to the floor </p>
<p>‘…Keu-heuk . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo swallowed back the pained moan . From that unexpected attack, he ended up receiving an unexpectedly large amount of damage . Unfortunately, the angel statue had already arrived in front of Jin-Woo’s nose, evidently not keen on giving him any time to reorganise himself </p>
<p>Boom!!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo tilted his head to the side and evaded the fist of the angel statue . It left a massive hole on the wall behind him, instead </p>
<p>That was just the beginning </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s back was up against the wall . The angel statue blocked off his route of retreat and then, its eight fists ruthlessly rained down on him </p>
<p>Attacks poured down without a single break in between, each punch powerful enough to kill a high-ranking Hunter in a single hit </p>
<p>Tudududududududu-!!. </p>
<p>As time wore on, though – the eyes of the angel statue were growing wider and wider, instead </p>
<p>‘He’s… blocking my punches?’. </p>
<p>The bombardment of attacks from eight separate arms was being blocked, deflected, or was redirected by just two arms . His movements were so fast that he simply looked like a collection of afterimages now </p>
<p>The angel statue was inwardly impressed by this display </p>
<p>From the very beginning, the end result of this battle was already set in stone . No, this was just one of the formalities to go through . And that would be the statue performing a once-over of Jin-Woo for the last time whether he agreed to it or not . Normally, this process itself should have been a rather boring one to go through . But now… </p>
<p>‘Isn’t this amusing . ’. </p>
<p>To think, it’d start enjoying a fight against a human like this . The angel statue had never once thought that a mere human could ever be an even match in its long, long life </p>
<p>The moment its thoughts reached there, a light suddenly flashed in its vision . No, it wasn’t actually light </p>
<p>It was a punch the human threw at the statue </p>
<p>Boom-!!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo jumped up and threw a punch . It hit the face of the angel statue, resulting in it being unceremoniously deposited on to the ground and rolling away in the dirt . It still stood right back up again, though </p>
<p>There were minute cracks developing on its still-smiling face </p>
<p>[Hahah . ]. </p>
<p>How long had it been since it felt this joyous?. </p>
<p>The angel statue was so excited that it began to shudder in regret from the shortness of the remaining time </p>
<p>“Fuu-woo… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo managed to land a good-looking hit on the angel statue, but he didn’t bother to celebrate his feat . He instead spat out heavy, laboured breaths </p>
<p>‘It’s strong . ’. </p>
<p>Indeed, his opponent was way stronger than any enemy he had faced so far </p>
<p>This ‘thing’ introduced itself as the architect of the System </p>
<p>The questions of why it created the System, why he was chosen as a Player, and just what was going on with this world – the questions he wanted to ask so badly were already forming a small mountain in his head </p>
<p>‘If I want to ask them… . ’. </p>
<p>He needed to prioritise bringing that thing down first . Jin-Woo clenched his fists tightly . It was then </p>
<p>He felt a warm, sticky liquid sliding down his face . It was his blood </p>
<p>It was trickling out from a tear on his forehead </p>
<p>‘I guess I didn’t dodge everything, huh . ’. </p>
<p>He thought that he perfectly countered all those attacks, but it seemed that one or two did get through to him . What bad luck it was, his blood seeping into his eye and interfering with his vision </p>
<p>On the other hand, the enemy was completely fine . It’d be very hard to describe this situation as a good one for him, even if he were to exaggerate somewhat </p>
<p>‘Fighting up close puts me in a disadvantage . ’. </p>
<p>That was a rather obvious assessment to make . The enemy’s physique was several times larger than his, and it also enjoyed the benefit of having six more arms, too </p>
<p>Realistically speaking, it was nigh impossible to evade or defend against speedy attacks coming in from all sorts of angles . The wound on his forehead attested to that fact </p>
<p>‘In that case . ’. </p>
<p>It was time to change the look of this battle just a tiny bit </p>
<p>The moment he made up his mind as thus, the angel statue flew in like an arrow and swung its big fist at him </p>
<p>Ka-ka-boom!!. </p>
<p>The punch sliced open the air and crashed into the wall . It collapsed into countless pieces of rubble . The angel statue tilted its head to the side </p>
<p>Jin-Woo had taken some distance away from his enemy even before the statue had the chance to consciously realise it </p>
<p>‘I certainly am a match for it in terms of speed . ’. </p>
<p>So, if he maintained this distance and damaged it from afar… </p>
<p>Jin-Woo immediately activated ‘Ruler’s Authority’ towards the angel statue as it turned around to face him </p>
<p>Pow!!. </p>
<p>The powerful attack pressing down from the sky to the ground!. </p>
<p>The technique used to swat the king of the ants, Beru, off the air swooped down on the angel statue’s head . However… </p>
<p>‘… . ?’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo did a quick double take </p>
<p>The skill that managed to tilt the torso of the massive god statue only managed to tilt the head of the angel ever so slightly . He couldn’t be sure, but the opponent seemed to have activated a skill of its own to defend itself . There was no other explanation he could think of other than that one </p>
<p>‘What could it be?’. </p>
<p>His confused state couldn’t be maintained for long </p>
<p>[How amusing . So very amusing . ]. </p>
<p>From some time ago, the angel statue’s low voice and the System’s mechanical female-like voice were overlapping in his ears . That unnatural combination was really getting on his nerves a bit </p>
<p>[This is so very amusing . ]. </p>
<p>The angel extended all of its eight arms out, and the weapons previously held by the stone statues began vibrating on the ground </p>
<p>‘Isn’t that… . ?’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s eyes widened greatly </p>
<p>The weapons of the stone statues soon rose up in the air and flew towards the angel . Eight different weapons were now tightly grasped in the angel’s eight hands all at once </p>
<p>‘That’s Ruler’s Reach . ’. </p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the angel statue also knew how to use the skill ‘Ruler’s Reach’ . Its power seemed to be below Jin-Woo’s own skill, but whatever the case may have been, he now knew what the angel used to counter the attack earlier on </p>
<p>Indeed, this thing was not an ordinary opponent at all </p>
<p>Tick </p>
<p>Abruptly, Jin-Woo’s gaze shifted up </p>
<p>[Remaining time: 06:19]. </p>
<p>And now, he only had roughly six minutes left </p>
<p>‘I need to finish this quickly . ’. </p>
<p>He learned that long distance attacks weren’t going to work . Jin-Woo revised his plan once more and summoned the ‘Demon King’s Shortsword’ again . The other one that he tossed away in a hurry was currently nowhere to be seen </p>
<p>‘Fighting against eight weapons with a single shortsword, is it?’. </p>
<p>Ba-thump, ba-thump!!. </p>
<p>The more he was pushed to the corner in a fight, the faster his heart beat </p>
<p>Taht </p>
<p>The angel statue jumped up high as if it wanted to touch the ceiling, before landing back down in front of Jin-Woo </p>
<p>Craaack!!. </p>
<p>The stone tiles on the floor couldn’t endure against the falling statue’s momentum and spat out bits of debris as it shattered into countless pieces </p>
<p>Jin-Woo pointed forward with his shortsword as he felt the small pebbles pelting him on his ankles </p>
<p>‘I can do this . ’. </p>
<p>He definitely could do this . Jin-Woo stared into the angel statue’s eyes and calmly drew his breaths in . Immediately, he felt a chill brush run down his back . Sure enough, eight disparate weapons, such as a sword, a spear, a blade, an axe, a war hammer, etc . , flew at his way as if they all possessed individual wills </p>
<p>Fuu… </p>
<p>Jin-Woo spat out heavy, white-hot breaths, his brows shooting up high </p>
<p>Under the glare of the interior that was neither too bright nor too dark, the light in Jin-Woo’s eyes left behind long shimmering trails that chased after his movements </p>
<p>Kwagagwahk-!! Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-gwa-gwahk!!. </p>
<p>Would blocking countless flying bullets with bullets fired from an opposing gun create a cacophony of noise similar to this?. </p>
<p>The deafening roars continued on unabated as Jin-Woo and the angel statue exchanged innumerable attacks and counterattacks in an instant </p>
<p>Within the world slowed down to a crawl, only these two writhed and struggled mightily as if to rebel against the flow of time itself </p>
<p>There was no one superior or inferior; just an evenly-matched battle of blades where only one would emerge as the victor . Even then… </p>
<p>‘I can feel it . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s shoulder moved ever so slightly . The sword wielded by the angel statue brushed past his shoulder with a gap that couldn’t be detected by the naked eyes </p>
<p>He stopped caring about his other eye that couldn’t be used anymore . His sensory perception that had exceeded the extreme limits and stepped into a whole new realm helped him to read the trajectories of every weapon his enemy held </p>
<p>He began dodging every attack the angel statue threw at him by truly paper-thin margins and accurately landed his counters one by one </p>
<p>More and more wounds appeared on the statue . The angel’s speed remained constant, yet Jin-Woo was getting faster and faster </p>
<p>Naturally, the angel statue was deeply astonished by this </p>
<p>“… !!”. </p>
<p>If it was only for the purpose of a test, there was no reason to go this far . However, this human had managed to draw out the angel’s full power </p>
<p>Indeed, just as the term implied – it had to fight with everything it had </p>
<p>But then, a human was able to fight evenly against the angel statue going at full tilt?. </p>
<p>The angel’s puzzled, suspicious eyes began peering deeper into Jin-Woo now . And then, it realised the reason for this </p>
<p>‘It’s only by a little, but… it’s mixed in there . ’. </p>
<p>Flinch </p>
<p>The shoulders of the angel statue trembled in shock . Was that the reason why he could freely wield the immense power so naturally like this?. </p>
<p>However, that was also another thing this ‘creature’ wished for from the beginning, anyway </p>
<p>Just as the look of elation formed on the angel statue’s face, a cleanly sliced off arm flew up into the air . The statue’s head was raised up to look at it </p>
<p>The arm let go of a weapon as it flew away… . it was the angel’s right arm </p>
<p>[Kuuuwaaahhk!!]. </p>
<p>Even if this statue was not its real body, the pain still got transmitted in full . The angel statue tottered unsteadily and retreated after losing its arm in the blink of an eye </p>
<p>[How dare a measly human!]. </p>
<p>The colour of the angel statue’s eyes reddened in an instant . Its true nature woke up and it forgot its true purpose, its duty, for being here </p>
<p>[You dare!!]. </p>
<p>It cried out in anger, and the fallen, destroyed stone statues all stood right back up </p>
<p>BOOM!. </p>
<p>Even the god statue and its partially-destroyed head began pushing off the ground as well </p>
<p>Jin-Woo could sense all the enemies being reanimated, but he didn’t fall into a panic and simply pounced on the angel statue again </p>
<p>Clang!!. </p>
<p>The four arms of the angel were used to block a single shortsword, yet it was shoved far, far back from the impact force </p>
<p>Agility, Perception, Strength, and even Stamina – all of Jin-Woo’s Stats had far exceeded the expectation of the angel statue </p>
<p>[Kuwahk!!]. </p>
<p>The angel statue roared out like a wild beast, and the reanimated stone statues pounced on Jin-Woo . And so, the fight between every single thing within this temple and the lone human commenced </p>
<p>Tick </p>
<p>[03:02]. </p>
<p>Even in the midst of all this chaos, the timer was still resolutely ticking down to zero </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s shortsword sliced away yet another of the angel statue’s arms . This time, it was one of the six created out of its wings </p>
<p>[Kuwaaahhk!!]. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resistance of the reanimated stone statues was nothing to scoff at </p>
<p>There were far too many of them surrounding him now and it became too much of a task to dodge every single attack coming his way . He focused on attacking the angel statue and dodged only those attacks that might critically injure him while ignoring the rest </p>
<p>His HP and Stamina were cut down in double time </p>
<p>Stab!. </p>
<p>A stone statue slammed down with its shield on his left shoulder </p>
<p>‘Keuk!’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo diverted his attention towards this particular statue </p>
<p>It was preparing to strike for the second time with its shield . Jin-Woo’s expression crumpled into something unsightly . He didn’t really care about others, but he simply couldn’t forgive this b*stard </p>
<p>Only then did Jin-Woo move slightly away from the angel statue; using the elbow of his left arm not holding a weapon, he stomped the head of the offending statue </p>
<p>CRACK!. </p>
<p>The elbow drop containing magic energy ensured that the statue’s head exploded into tiny bits and pieces </p>
<p>In the meantime, other statues quickly surrounded him and tried to jump on top of him . However, Jin-Woo simply activated his skill and pushed them all away </p>
<p>‘Ruler’s Authority!’. </p>
<p>BOOM!!. </p>
<p>A group of stone statues were flung away as if they were thrown off from the centre of an explosion </p>
<p>“Pant, pant… . ”. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even before Jin-Woo had time to catch his breath, the god statue threw its massive fist down on his head . He lightly leapt to his side and avoided it </p>
<p>Vuuwuong-!!. </p>
<p>The gigantic fist only managed to sweep away dozens of stone statues from Jin-Woo’s vicinity . He ran in a wide arc to lose the stone statues mindlessly trying to jump on him and approached the angel statue again </p>
<p>And the angel greeted him with a deeply crumpled expression . That was the expression of pure rage </p>
<p>For the second time today, Jin-Woo, the angel statue, and the stone statues all fell into a frenzied melee . His blood and sweat danced in the air and flew everywhere . But, all of that lasted only for a brief moment </p>
<p>Soon, blood and sweat evaporated from the sheer heat generated and red mist rose up from Jin-Woo’s shoulders </p>
<p>The stone statues were forced back, the god statue slammed its fist down, and the arms of the angel statue busily moved about . And in the middle of it all stood Jin-Woo </p>
<p>[Kuwaaahhk!!]. </p>
<p>Another one of the angel’s arms flew off, and Jin-Woo’s shortsword found itself pressed tightly against the angel statue’s neck . Way above both of them, the god statue was about to pound down with its two hands locked together </p>
<p>Jin-Woo calmly strengthened the arm pressing the blade to the angel statue’s neck to cut it off in one go </p>
<p>At that moment, the angel statue announced its surrender </p>
<p>[I lost . ]. </p>
<p>Simultaneously, the god statue and the rest of the stone statues all froze up and stopped moving </p>
<p>[Your test has ended . ]. </p>
<p>Tick </p>
<p>Like a lie, the timer ceaselessly ticking down also froze up along with the angel’s words announcing the end of everything </p>
<p>[Remaining time: 02:11]. </p>
<p>Red hot steam was rising up in a fine mist from Jin-Woo’s entire body </p>
<p>Only after confirming that the timer had stopped for real, he lowered his head . His glare was locked onto the angel statue </p>
<p>“I have a question . ”. </p>
<p>[You can ask anything . I shall answer if it’s within my knowledge . ]. </p>
<p>Rather unexpectedly, the now-expressionless angel statue agreed to his demand without offering any resistance </p>
<p>‘… ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn’t say anything and thought to himself </p>
<p>When he asked the angel statue ‘What are you’, the thing mocked him for asking the wrong question </p>
<p>However, his confusion got more confounded after he heard the identity of this ‘thing’ from its own mouth, and now, he had more questions than ever before burning a hole in his head </p>
<p>That was why Jin-Woo decided to heed the advice the angel gave him earlier on and ask the right question </p>
<p>“Who am I?”. </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 158 &gt; Fin </p>
