<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 50</p>
<p>Jinwoo could not believe what he was hearing . </p>
<p>‘ . Penalty Zone?’</p>
<p>Ah-</p>
<p>He remembered .  He did not do the daily quest today .  He had purposely skipped it to enter the Penalty Zone, in order to test out his progress against the centipedes and see if he could continue the Demon Castle Raid .  To think that it would work out like this . </p>
<p>shaaaaaake-</p>
<p>Like back in the hospital, the area started shaking vigorously . </p>
<p>pshhhh</p>
<p>pshaaaaah</p>
<p>One by one, even the knights that he was fighting turned into sand . </p>
<p>The world changed around him . </p>
<p>‘Ha… ha ha…’</p>
<p>He silently laughed .  The System’s words before the quest started kept appearing in his head . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>I wish you luck . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Was it because it was that difficult of a quest? Or did it want him to be lucky in obtaining more advancement points?</p>
<p>Luck, coincidence, call it what you want .  It was just another chance for him . The important thing was how he would use this chance . </p>
<p>Shaaaake-!</p>
<p>The tremors became stronger .  Instead of fighting to keep his balance like in the past, Jinwoo gave himself up to the earthquake and closed his eyes . </p>
<p>‘Be calm…’</p>
<p>And just like that, he felt a sense of weightlessness, and all sounds disappeared .  When he opened his eyes, it was in the middle of a familiar desert . Jinwoo collapsed onto the sand . </p>
<p>“gasp- gasp- pant- pant-”</p>
<p>He grabbed the sand with his hands and let loose a torrent of panting .  His lungs filled with a refreshing breath of air, spreading the feeling to his entire body . </p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>“I feel alive . ”</p>
<p>With the sense of safety surrounding his mind, Jinwoo stayed lying on the ground .  He looked up at the empty, black sky . The vision of an endless pitch black ceiling filled his view .  It was the Penalty Zone that he remembered . </p>
<p>‘Oh wait, now’s not the time to be lying down . ’</p>
<p>Because he had just escaped from an incredibly dangerous place, he forgot that this place was not exactly a safe one .  Still, he didn’t want to get-up, so he called up the status screen while lying down . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>HP: 104 / 10,270</strong>. </p>
<p>MP: 202 / 850</p>
<p>Fatigue: 91</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He wondered why it was so hard to move .  Now he knew why; his fatigue had risen over 90 . </p>
<p>‘This is the first time that happened, I think . ’</p>
<p>He didn’t feel like moving a finger right now .  His health was one thing, but at the moment, it was important to recover his stamina . </p>
<p>“Shop . ”</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>The words “Buy” and “Sell” appeared in the air .  No matter how he looked at it, the System had clearly created the so-called shop with the bare minimum of effort, but today, it was an incredibly welcoming sight .  Jinwoo purchased the most expensive healing potion . The moment he confirmed the transaction,</p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>A glass bottle with a red liquid appeared in his sprawled arm .  </p>
<p>pop</p>
<p>In his state, it took effort even to uncork the bottle .  He poured the potion down his mouth . </p>
<p>gulp gulp </p>
<p>The red liquid passed through his throat . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your stamina is recovered . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your stamina is recovered . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your stamina is recovered . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Since it was the highest level healing potion, just one bottle was enough to completely undo his fatigue .  Strangely, his health did not recover . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>HP: 106 / 10,270</strong>. </p>
<p>MP: 204 / 850</p>
<p>Fatigue: 0</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Even when the bottle was emptied, his health stayed the same .  It was drastically different than the fatigue that was now zero .  </p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>The moment the last drop of potion fell into his mouth, he was able to find out why . </p>
<p>ring . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your health is below 10% . You cannot recover your health with a potion . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The reason was simple .  It was because his health was too low . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it…’</p>
<p>Even healing magic had their limits .  This was not an unfamiliar phenomenon .  Just as Healers could not heal someone past a certain point depending on their skill, it appeared that potions had similar limits . </p>
<p>‘And you're telling me that the limit is 10% remaining health . ’</p>
<p>This was good to know .  Had he placed faith in the potion at a wrong time, he could’ve made a grave mistake .  This is why experience was important . Wasn’t there a saying?</p>
<p>“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger . ”</p>
<p>That was all due to the power of experience .  Even right now, he thankfully had the experience of encountering the Penalty Zone . </p>
<p>‘It’s about time…’</p>
<p>And indeed it was .  He felt a lifeform rising beneath the sand .  Jinwoo raised his legs and shot up from the ground .  His body felt as light as a feather . Thanks to the potion, his strength had completely returned .  Jinwoo landed few steps away and turned around . </p>
<p>shaaaaah</p>
<p>As expected, the spot he was lying on was sinking to the ground . </p>
<p>‘Heh, I remember thinking that I’d slip and fall into that in the past . ’</p>
<p>Now, he could stare at the sinkhole with a carefree attitude .  The bottom of the depression boiled like in the past, and-</p>
<p>pshaaaah!</p>
<p>A column of sand exploded from the ground, revealing the form of the giant centipede . </p>
<p>screeeeech!</p>
<p>It was all just as he remembered . </p>
<p>‘Man, they looked a lot scarier back then…’</p>
<p>Now, they appeared to be moving in slow motion in Jinwoo’s eyes .  He raised his gaze and confirmed the red letters above the centipede’s head . </p>
<p>‘Poison-fanged Giant Sand Centipede’</p>
<p>A red name .  Just like the Cerberus from the Demon Castle .  The quest message appeared . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Penalty Quest: Survive</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Goal: Survive for the required time . </strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Required time: 4 Hours</strong>.   </p>
<p>Remaining time: 4 Hours 0 Min 0 Sec</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>After reading the message, Jinwoo clenched his fists . </p>
<p>‘I can buy some time with this . ’</p>
<p>As he did not use the Instant Return Stone out of the Dungeon, he probably still had a chance . </p>
<p>‘I’ll probably be moved back after the penalty quest . ’</p>
<p>And if the 4 hours he spent here was added to the endurance timer? The advancement points he would gain would be massive .  Well, he still did not know just how the math worked . </p>
<p>‘Still…’</p>
<p>When he thought about how the System worked up until now, this might become an incredible windfall . </p>
<p>‘Four fucking hours!’</p>
<p>He couldn’t last 10 minutes back there and was about to use the Instant Return Stone .  Now, thanks to the Penalty Zone, he would be able to add 4 hours to that timer . There was one problem left .  He had to survive this world with barely a 100 health remaining . Since he could not recover using a potion, he had to level-up through the centipedes without receiving any damage .  In a way, this was an additional condition of the penalty quest . </p>
<p>‘ . Let’s do this . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo summoned Casaka’s Poisoned Fang . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Remaining time: 3 Hours 59 Min 59 Sec</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The moment the penalty quest started, Jinwoo began to move .  Because of his experience, he knew to move before the centipedes did .  He closed the distance in a flash and jumped . </p>
<p>land!</p>
<p>He reached a halfway point on the insect’s body then started working his way to the head while slashing at its body . </p>
<p>stab! stab stab! slash!</p>
<p>Wherever the dagger attacked, the exoskeleton of the centipede cracked and seeped a liquid . </p>
<p>screeeech!</p>
<p>Every time Jinwoo made a new wound on its body, the centipede thrashed in pain . </p>
<p>‘Sprint!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s legs sped up . </p>
<p>step, step, step, step!</p>
<p>He quickly reached the top of the monster’s head and grabbed the dagger with both hands . </p>
<p>‘Vital Stab!’</p>
<p>He used the skill and brought down the dagger onto the centipede’s head .  The dagger dug deep into the head . </p>
<p>crack!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>‘Vital Stab’ has leveled up!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Alright!’</p>
<p>It had been a while! The leveled-up skill appeared to have done quite a damage .  The centipede shook its head in pain . </p>
<p>screech, screee!</p>
<p>Jinwoo did not stop there .  He moved from its head towards the centipede’s back .  The monster’s back was completely exposed . </p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>After stabbing a point behind the centipede’s head, Jinwoo held the dagger in place and jumped down .  </p>
<p>cra-cra-cra-cra-craaaaaack!</p>
<p>Combined with the strength over 120 and a leap from a height of a 5 story building, the dagger slid completely across the centipede’s back, cutting it wide open . </p>
<p>cra-cra-crack!</p>
<p>land . </p>
<p>Jinwoo landed safely . </p>
<p>screeech, screeeeee!</p>
<p>The centipede spewed a liquid all over the place then finally fell . </p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Its body raised up a cloud of sand . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated the Poison-fanged Giant Sand Centipede</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo patted the sand off his body and checked the time . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Remaining time: 3 Hours 59 Min 42 Sec</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘That took 17 seconds . ’</p>
<p>It took him less than 20 seconds to take down the centipede .  It was completely different than the time he took down the Cerberus .  His strength had reached a different dimension . </p>
<p>‘Well, if I think about all the leveling I did and the items I’ve obtained…’</p>
<p>It made sense .  At this rate, Jinwoo was confident he could continue hunting without losing life . </p>
<p>‘Now the problem is if there are enough monsters here for a level-up…’</p>
<p>Only then would he have a chance of surviving when he went back to the class advancement quest .  If he went back without recovering his health, he was sure to be crushed like an insect . As he was deep in worry, multiple sand columns appeared around him . </p>
<p>pshhhhh-</p>
<p>pshaaaah-</p>
<p>The centipedes had arrived after smelling their kin’s blood . </p>
<p>screeech-</p>
<p>screeech-</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s face brightened . </p>
<p>‘Just how many are there?’</p>
<p>Looking at the heads of the centipedes popping up from the ground, Jinwoo could not hide the smile on his face . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve leveled up!</strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>It was about time he’d return .  Jinwoo looked around at the corpses of the centipedes that littered the area .  Thanks to their sacrifice, he was able to recover his health . </p>
<p>‘It’s a shame they didn’t drop any items or gold…’</p>
<p>Well, it wouldn’t have made sense for a place of punishment to reward him that much .  Now, it was time to prepare for his return . </p>
<p>‘Shop . ’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Current Gold: 3,115,629</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>On top of the various moneybags from the humanoid monsters, he had earned a whopping 1,500,000 gold from Ygritte .  He had plenty of funds now . With that in mind, he looked through the shop for a new weapon . A suitable upgrade caught his eye:</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Knight Killer</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: B</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Dagger</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Attack Power +75</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>‘Knight Killing’: +25% damage against heavy armored opponents</strong>.   </p>
<p>It’s a sturdy and sharp dagger designed to cut a knight’s armor . Because of its serrated blades, it will not slip easily against armor . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>It was a weapon meant to be used for killing heavily armored targets .  The cost was 2,800,000 gold . He would have to spend most of his gold, but this was not the time to be stingy . </p>
<p>‘Can’t take my gold with me to the afterlife . ’</p>
<p>Without hesitating, Jinwoo bought the weapon .  Additionally, he also purchased some wrappings . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve purchased “Knight Killer” . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve purchased “Wrappings” . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As its description noted, it was a scary looking dagger with a serrated blade .  He took the weapon with his right hand and used the wrappings to tightly bind it in his hand . </p>
<p>slash! slash slash!</p>
<p>He swung the blade around .  It felt natural in his hand, as if it was a part of his body . </p>
<p>‘At the very least, I won’t be dropping it like this . ’</p>
<p>He briefly considered wrapping Casaka’s Poisoned Fang to his left hand but decided against it .  It would be too inconvenient to lose both of his hands . He would keep the usage of his left hand just in case .  He placed the leftover wrappings into the inventory then noticed the Runestone he had gotten from Ygritte . </p>
<p>‘Ah right, there was this . ’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Runestone: Ruler’s Hands</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Break the Runestone to absorb the skill . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He needed every little bit right now, whether it was an item or a skill .  Jinwoo smashed the Runestone without a regret . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve learned ‘Ruler’s Hands’ (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Ruler’s Hands (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Mana Cost: 0</strong>.   </p>
<p>Exert your will over an object without physically touching it . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Ah…’</p>
<p>Reading the explanation, he remembered a scene from earlier .  It was when Ygritte stretched a hand to his sword and brought it to his hands from a distance . </p>
<p>‘So he used this skill to move the longsword . ’</p>
<p>A skill to move an object from a distance just with his mind! On top of that, it didn’t have a mana cost . </p>
<p>‘If I can really move anything, it’s an incredible skill . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly tried it out on the corpse of the centipede next to him . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your proficiency is insufficient to move the object . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your proficiency is insufficient to move the object . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>It seemed that moving something heavy required more practice . </p>
<p>‘What about this one?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo dropped Casaka’s Poisoned Fang onto the ground, then stretched a hand toward it .  The dagger easily moved into his hand . </p>
<p>grab!</p>
<p>‘Oh~ . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the dagger with amazement . </p>
<p>‘Alright, this is helpful enough . ’</p>
<p>And with that, he had completed all preparations .  Jinwoo raised his head and saw that the time was almost over . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Remaining time: 0 Hours 0 Min 4 Sec</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As the 4 seconds decreased to 3, the System messaged him . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Penalty Quest will end soon . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>And another one followed,</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Because you’ve hunted in the Penalty Zone,</strong>. </p>
<p>The next Penalty Quest’s difficulty will be adjusted . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>An adjustment of difficulty .  It would make it harder to hunt so that the penalty will feel like a penalty .  Well, would there even be a next time? Jinwoo gulped . </p>
<p>‘Now, the class advancement quest will resume . ’</p>
<p>Hundreds of monsters would probably be waiting for him back in the boss room .  Perhaps even more . Although he thought of it as “returning” to the room, it was more like he was being “thrown” back there . </p>
<p>Health, mana, fatigue, equipment and skill .  In addition to those, even his mind had improved in the past 4 hours .  Still, he was feeling nervous . </p>
<p>ba dum ba dum ba dum</p>
<p>The beating of his heart was almost painful .  </p>
<p>Jinwoo closed his eyes to calm himself . </p>
<p>Then, the electronic tone rang . </p>
<p>ring . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Penalty Quest will end now . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘This is my last chance…’</p>
<p>When Jinwoo opened his eyes, he saw the mass of silver knights starting to turn towards him .  They were not his target . Jinwoo’s eyes shifted side to side, looking for his target . </p>
<p>‘First, the mages!’</p>
