<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 37</p>
<p>The Gate that stood behind them was big even for a C-rank Gate .  The waiting Hunters approached Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho who got out of their Bongo .  None of them were… normal . </p>
<p>Some of them appeared to have trouble moving, others looked like patients, while some even gave off the impression of an alcoholic .  There was even an underage girl, whose age would mean that she would not be accepted by the Association or the Guilds; she appeared to be a highschool student .  </p>
<p>“Is it okay to bring that one?”</p>
<p>“I went ahead and got some legal counsel . There isn’t any legal reason why she can’t join us . It’s just going to be a big problem if she gets hurt . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded . </p>
<p>‘That should be alright, then . ’</p>
<p>As the only ones entering the gate would be him and Yoo Jinho, there was no chance that she would get hurt .  All that the gathered Hunters would be used for is to fill the minimum headcount to enter the Gate . The other Hunters were well aware of this .  Although they had their Hunter licenses, they could not work as Hunters due to various reasons . Having lived an ordinary life because of those reasons, they readily agreed to be recruited as just filler members . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho stepped forward,</p>
<p>“My name is Yoo Jinho . I will be this Raid’s leader . And this person is Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim . He’s the only other person who will enter the Dungeon with me . The rest of you can just wait near the Gate until we return . ”</p>
<p>One of the Hunters cautiously raised a hand,</p>
<p>“Er… So if we just wait out here, you’ll pay us three million?”</p>
<p>There was no need for the rest of them to hunt .  There wasn’t even a need for them to enter the Dungeon .  Yet they would be paid 3 million per Raid . For just filling the headcount for the Association’s records, this was an incredible compensation .  But because of the large reward for doing so little, many of the Hunters were cautious . </p>
<p>“Yes, that is the promise . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho gathered strength in his lungs; his eyes became serious . </p>
<p>“There is one condition . You must not speak of what you see here to anyone . There will be a non-disclosure clause attached to your contracts . Upon breaking that contract, you will be required to pay ten times your pay as penalty . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters whispered among themselves .  Just what did these two plan to do in the Dungeon that they would offer such a contract? They were curious, but they could not ask any questions . That was also part of the non-disclosure clause . </p>
<p>[“No questions on what’s going to happen in the Dungeon . ”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo wanted to keep his special circumstances secret, while Yoo Jinho wanted to keep his plans to become a Guildmaster secret .  As such, they thoroughly planned to maintain the silence of their filler teammates . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Instead of asking the duo questions, the Hunters just whispered among themselves about the situation . </p>
<p>“Wait, could just two people even do anything in a C-rank Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“They don’t seem that strong…”</p>
<p>“If they were good enough to clear a C-rank Gate with just the two of them, why wouldn’t they be working for a large Guild?”</p>
<p>“Yep, you’re right…”</p>
<p>They were all suspicious, but not one of them wanted to back out .  The reason was obvious . The conditions were too good . Even Jinwoo had accepted similar conditions for 2 million before .  Compared to the Hwang Dongseok incident, they pair had decided to add an additional 1 million to the contract for the non-disclosure clause . </p>
<p>They’ve wasted enough time explaining everything .  Looking at the time, Jinwoo approached Yoo Jinho,</p>
<p>“We should get going . ”</p>
<p>“Understood, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho replied politely, then grabbed everyone’s attention with a clap . </p>
<p>“Well, I think we’re done explaining the details . We won’t be forcing anyone to sign . Is there anyone who wants to backout at this point?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Of course, there was no one who raised their hands .  Now, the pair could enter the Gate-</p>
<p>“Ah, hyungnim, one moment . ”</p>
<p>As if remembering something, Yoo Jinho quickly ran to the Bongo .  He took something out of the car and started putting it on, then slowly lumbered toward Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“What… are you wearing?”</p>
<p>“It was made by a Craftsmen Guild in Italy . It’s a full set of strong armor, hyungnim . If it’s just going to be us two in the Dungeon, I should prepare at least this much, right?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo facepalmed . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Covered from tip of the head to toes in armor, Yoo Jinho looked like a giant walking piece of metal .  Even just looking at him gave off a sense of claustrophobia . </p>
<p>“What’s wrong, hyungnim?”</p>
<p>Unable to take it any longer, Jinwoo walked over and unsheathe the sword at Yoo Jinho’s side and dropped it at his feet . </p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho lost his balance trying to pick up the sword and fell flat onto the ground . </p>
<p>collapse</p>
<p>Jinwoo held back the rage that was forming inside of him and spoke sternly to the young man,</p>
<p>“I’ll say this once . Go take it off . ”</p>
<p>“…Yes sir…”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho started getting up then spoke,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Could you please help me up . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo sighed deeply at Yoo Jinho’s outstretched hand . </p>
<p>“Is this okay, hyungnim?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s fine . ”</p>
<p>In the end, they agreed that Yoo Jinho would at least wear the helmet .  The young man entered the Gate with a satisfied expression; Jinwoo wordlessly followed suit . </p>
<p>After the pair entered the Gate, the Hunters approached it one by one and stared .  One of them spoke with a worry,</p>
<p>“They didn’t exactly inspire confidence…”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>Their words broke the dam of silence of the other Hunters .  They all had something they wanted to say . </p>
<p>“What happens if those two just kick it in the Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“Well, we already received the money…”</p>
<p>“Still…”</p>
<p>“Wait, what were their names again?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, it was…”</p>
<p>A man with a cast on one of his legs quickly took out his phone and looked their employers up . </p>
<p>“Yoo Jinho, Sung Jinwoo…”</p>
<p>Whether they were concerned for the man standing up with a crutch or they were curious on what he had found, the other Hunters helped the man stand while looking at his phone . </p>
<p>“What? The Raid leader’s a D-rank?”</p>
<p>The Hunters groaned at this news .  The next bit of information surprised them even more . </p>
<p>“And the other one’s an E-ranker!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t is dangerous for an E-ranker to even enter a C-rank Gate?”</p>
<p>“A D-ranker and an E-ranker is going to clear a C-rank Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“Is that possible?”</p>
<p>“Hell, the Raid leader doesn’t even have any prior experiences!”</p>
<p>“Why would someone so young do this?”</p>
<p>To the other Hunters, Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho’s actions were just suicide with extra steps .  There was a reason why the Association placed a restriction of a minimum headcount for C-rank Gates: 10 Hunters, with at least half of them being above C-rank . </p>
<p>“Tsk, tsk . ”</p>
<p>A man with greying hair took out a cigarette and placed it in his mouth . </p>
<p>“I tell you, rashness is the death of many youths . ”</p>
<p>A white smoke filled the air . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The Hunters became at a loss for words .  Having felt like they’ve assisted in someone else’s suicide, they did not feel good .  Even if it was a complete stranger, no one wanted to see, or rather, know that someone was about to die in the Gate in front of them .  Not only that, they felt disappointed at the idea that they would not be paid for the remaining 18 Raids . It was regrettable, but there was no way those two men would be coming back alive . </p>
<p>“Should… should we call the Association?”</p>
<p>“No, what if we get blamed during the investigation?”</p>
<p>At that time, the Gate rippled, and Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho came out of the Dungeon . </p>
<p>“pant, pant, pant . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho was taking vigorous breaths .  The two men’s faces were filled with exhaustion . </p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>“They escaped safely!”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters greeted the pair with welcome .  Because of the short time they were in the Dungeon, the Hunters had thought that the pair wandered aimlessly at the entrance and managed to run away .  But suddenly, the Hunters’ expressions started changing . Someone shouted,</p>
<p>“Th-the Gate! The Gate is closing!”</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>They all turned towards the Gate . </p>
<p>“Holy shit!”</p>
<p>“It is!”</p>
<p>“They-they took down the boss?!”</p>
<p>As it always would when the boss was taken down, the Gate was rippling and blurring, signaling its closing .  While the Hunters opened their mouths wide in surprise, Jinwoo quietly slipped away from them and asked Yoo Jinho,</p>
<p>“Where’s the next one?”</p>
<p>“It’s about an hour drive from here, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>“Let’s go . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho got in the Bongo .  The Hunters were watching their backs with dumbfounded expressions .  Realizing the other Hunters were not moving, Yoo Jinho shouted after them,</p>
<p>“Let’s go please, Hunter-nims . We have to cover two more Gates today . ”</p>
<p>The other Hunters’ mouths opened even wider .  The middle-aged Hunter with the greying hair didn’t even realize his cigarette had fallen out of his open mouth . </p>
<p>‘They just smashed a C-rank Dungeon and they’re going on another Raid?’</p>
<p>He wasn’t the only one with the thought .  All the other Hunters were thinking something similar . </p>
<p>‘Just what are those two?’</p>
<p>Day 1 . </p>
<p>groooooan</p>
<p>The zombie horde approached . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim, here they come!”</p>
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo smoothly slipped through the approaching zombies .  As he passed them, the heads of zombies fell onto the ground .  Their numbers diminished quickly . </p>
<p>One left . </p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>groooan!</p>
<p>As Jinwoo stabbed its chest with the dagger, the familiar electronic tone rang . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve leveled up!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Watching from the rear, Yoo Jinho clapped rapidly in awe . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim! You look so cool!”</p>
<p>“The magic cores . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, right . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho quickly started to gather the magic cores into his bag .  Meanwhile, the electronic tone that only Jinwoo could hear continued after the level-up message . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>

<p>Jinwoo’s expression became bright . </p>
<p>‘New skills?’</p>
<p>How long has it been? Jinwoo immediately opened his skill screen with joy . </p>

<p>Having used it so often, ‘Sprint’ had leveled up to level 2 .  And he gained a passive skill and an active skill, ‘Advanced Dagger Proficiency’ and ‘Vital Stab’ . [1]</p>

<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Advanced Dagger Proficiency” (상급 단검술): “high level” 상급 + “dagger” 단검 + “arts/skill” “술” .  Took a video game approach and decided to call it “Advanced Dagger Proficiency” . </p>
<p>“Vital Stab” (급소 찌르기): “vital point/pressure point” 급소 + “stabbing” 찌르기 . Condensed to “Vital Stab”</p>
<p>[2]: Heheh, in the original Korean, there is actually a mistake here . The author forgot to put ‘Stealth’ in the skill listing . I added it in . </p>
