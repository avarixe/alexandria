<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 89</p>
<p>screech-</p>
<p>A black sedan stopped on the side of the road .  A man wearing sunglasses and a black suit got off from the car .  He was the Hunter Surveillance Department’s (HSD) Chief, Woo Jincheol .  Following him, three other HSD Hunters also got off from the car . </p>
<p>“Chief, why did we stop here? Weren’t we going directly to the Association?”</p>
<p>“I just have something I want to check out . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol turned his head towards the Gate in the distance . </p>
<p>‘No matter how many times I see it, an A-rank Gate is a dreadful thing . ’</p>
<p>The HSD chief furrowed his brows .  If that giant hole opened up and unleashed the magic beasts within… Even just imagining it made the A-rank Hunter shudder . </p>
<p>‘So why would that man volunteer as a miner in such a scary place?’</p>
<p>And not just for a single day but two .  Even if Association President Go Gunhee had not asked him personally, Woo Jincheol would’ve tried to find out on his own . </p>
<p>‘We can’t… investigate him behind his back . ’</p>
<p>“Him” was an S-rank Hunter .  It was impossible for an A-ranker like Woo Jincheol to secretly investigate an S-rank Hunter without being detected .  As such, the HSD chief had decided to appear boldly to check out what Jinwoo was up to . Since the HSD had another job nearby, he had thought to use the excuse that he was just passing by and wanted to give his greetings . </p>
<p>‘That won’t come off as too strange, right?’</p>
<p>If a Hunter that was confirmed to be an S-rank was doing a job digging away at the ground, anyone would be curious .  On top of that, Sung Jinwoo was someone who had the attention of the Hunter Association, especially the association president .  The association president must’ve really liked the man; recently, Woo Jincheol noticed that Go Gunhee had perked up both eyes and ears whenever Jinwoo was mentioned . </p>
<p>‘No, if anything, the strange one isn’t me . ’</p>
<p>Being curious was obvious, and asking few questions out of that curiosity was normal .  With that in mind, Woo Jincheol approached a Hunters Guild employee . </p>
<p>“Hello, I’m looking for the mining team . ”</p>
<p>“Excuse me . but who are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m from the Association . ”</p>
<p>After confirming Woo Jincheol’s identity, the employee gestured to where the mining team was on standby . </p>
<p>“You can find them over there . ”</p>
<p>“Thank you . ”</p>
<p>The four HSD Hunters went over to the mining team .  Having heard that they were on the way, Team Leader Bae came out running,</p>
<p>“Oh boy, to think that the Association’s HSD Hunter-nims would be paying us a visit today . How can we be of service?”</p>
<p>Having been resting comfortably only moments ago, the Hunters of the mining team now looked uneasy .  To Hunters, “HSD” was a rather threatening word to hear . After all, the HSD Hunters were the ones that dealt with Awakened Beings that could not be controlled by society’s laws and enforcement .  They would arrest, imprison and at times… eliminate such criminals . And now, these HSD Hunters were standing before them . </p>
<p>“What is it?”. “The HSD’s here . ”</p>
<p>“Why is the HSD…?”</p>
<p>Something was about to happen .  With a curiosity, the miners gathered next to Team Leader Bae .  Woo Jincheol removed his sunglasses . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>The A-ranker looked for Sung Jinwoo’s face .  When he didn’t find it, he decided to ask the team leader,</p>
<p>“Where is Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim?”</p>
<p>. <strong>“I knew it!”</strong>. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a man pushed his way through the miners .  It was the man who had tried to bully Sung Jinwoo yesterday, Lee Sunggu .  The man spat on the ground and went off in to a rant,</p>
<p>“That fucker turned around and looked at me while smiling! I swear, his eyes looked like they could swallow a person whole! Shit man, even thinking about it now makes me shake . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol’s brows furrowed slightly,</p>
<p>‘Eyes looking like they could swallow a person?’</p>
<p>Just what happened? The miners started to whisper among themselves .  Woo Jincheol ignored them and asked Lee Sunggu,</p>
<p>“Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s…”</p>
<p>The miner was about to reply, then realized that he was the one who tried to bully Jinwoo .  He quickly waved his hand,</p>
<p>“That’s not important . I’m telling you, the man’s eyes were just too scary . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol turned to Team Leader Bae again,</p>
<p>“Where is Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim now?”</p>
<p>“Er… Sung-ssi is inside the Gate right now . ”</p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo entered an A-rank Gate while the Raid was in progress? The HSD chief’s eyes grew wide . </p>
<p>“Why would Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim be in the Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“Well, the attack team’s porter didn’t come today . Sung-ssi was the only one who volunteered to go into the Dungeon as their porter . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>“You know it’s strange . ”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s nothing but… just now, Hunter Cha-nim, I mean, Hunter Cha Haein-nim also looked for Sung-ssi . When she heard that he had entered the Gate, she also went in . I just thought it was strange…”</p>
<p>Team Leader Bae tilted his head .  When he heard the man’s words, Woo Jincheol’s mind started turning frantically . </p>
<p>‘The Deputy Guildmaster of Hunters Guild looked for Sung Jinwoo? And she actually followed him into the Dungeon?’</p>
<p>Just what was going on? Woo Jincheol had only come here to give Sung Jinwoo his greetings, but it appeared that something was going out of hand . </p>
<p>‘First, let’s check out the Gate . ’</p>
<p>As members of the HSD, that was the least they could do . </p>
<p>“We’ll be checking the Gate out . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, understood . ”</p>
<p>As Woo Jincheol turned to leave with his subordinates, Lee Sunggu suddenly stopped them and spoke up,</p>
<p>“Er, Hunter-nim!”</p>
<p>The miner’s face was filled with anticipation and excitement,</p>
<p>“That fucker, Sung Jinwoo or something . Did he do something bad? Like kill a man? He seemed like the type . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol scrunched his face .  Suddenly, he realized just why Sung Jinwoo would glare at this man . </p>
<p>‘You look like you’d keel over if Sung Jinwoo so much as sneezed in your direction…’</p>
<p>Still, there were too many eyes here .  A representative of the Association couldn’t just berate or show anger at an ordinary Hunter .  At times like this, Woo Jincheol disliked his status in the organization . The HSD chief did his best to speak as diplomatically as possible,</p>
<p>“You’ll find out on tomorrow’s evening news . ”</p>
<p>As if that was the reply he was looking for, Lee Sunggu looked satisfied and vindicated,</p>
<p>“You see? What’d I tell you? That fucker was suspicious as hell!”</p>
<p>“He didn’t seem like that to me…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, seemed like a good worker . Pretty diligent . ”</p>
<p>Lee Sunggu ignored the lukewarm responses of his teammates and held his nose high at the idea that he was right all along .  Having enough of the pathetic man, Woo Jincheol took his subordinates and left toward the Gate . </p>
<p>flinch</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol instinctively stopped few steps before the Gate . </p>
<p>“Chief?”</p>
<p>The HSD Hunters looked at Woo Jincheol with confusion .  The man’s face was frozen . </p>
<p>‘What the hell… this is impossible . ’</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol took out his phone and pulled up this A-rank Gate’s information .  He was shocked at what he read,</p>
<p>‘Why is the magic power so low?’</p>
<p>He shook his head,</p>
<p>‘The measurement was off . ’</p>
<p>Not all A-rank Hunters were equal .  Woo Jincheol was at the upper echelon of the A-rank Hunters .  And his skilled senses were telling him: the magic power measurement was wrong .  He quickly turned to his side and gave an order,</p>
<p>“Magic power measuring device, now!”</p>
<p>Reading the mood, a subordinate quickly ran to the car and returned with the device .  The miniature measuring device used by the HSD were of a different class than the ones used by the ordinary Association employees .  As expected of a device made with a magic core costing a billion won, it rarely ever produced an incorrect measurement . </p>
<p>beep</p>
<p>The measurement finished . </p>
<p>‘I was right…’</p>
<p>The results were noticeably different than the measurement done by the normal Association employees .  If a Guild relied on the initial data from the Association in planning their raiding party, it would’ve ended in a disaster . </p>
<p>‘Shouldn’t be an issue now that two S-rankers are in there but…’</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol reached down to pick up the measuring device when suddenly,</p>
<p>wooong-</p>
<p>The Gate shook with a powerful vibration; it was not the same phenomenon as a Gate closing .  It was caused by a powerful wave of magic power being released from within . Putting the highly skilled Woo Jincheol aside, even the weaker senses of his subordinates were able to detect the powerful wave .  Each of them flinched and shook when they felt it,</p>
<p>“C-chief?”</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol looked at the youngest member who had turned pale,</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, sir . ”</p>
<p>After replying, the man carefully looked at the back of his hand .  It was filled with goosebumps . Woo Jincheol rose from the ground . </p>
<p>“We’re going inside . ”</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>“You want to go in there?”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol continued,</p>
<p>“Those afraid can remain behind . ”</p>
<p>The only ones who knew the measurement was wrong were the HSD Hunters here .  They had to relay this information to the Hunters inside . On top of managing and monitoring Hunters, it was the Association’s first and foremost duty to help Hunters . </p>
<p>“N-no . I’ll go . ”</p>
<p>“Let’s go together . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol nodded then turned to the youngest employee,</p>
<p>“You, stay here and report this to the Association . ”</p>
<p>“S-sir?”</p>
<p>“You can do it, right?”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol tapped him on his shoulder, and the youngest employee nodded with effort,</p>
<p>“Yes, I will do that . ”</p>
<p>The HSD chief turned back to the Gate .  On top of what they had felt just now, even more powerful wave of magic power poured out from the Gate . </p>
<p>‘Just what’s happening in there?’</p>
<p>With Woo Jincheol taking the lead, the three HSD Hunters threw themselves into the Gate . </p>
<p>A moment ago . </p>
<p>Cha Haein was tracing the steps of the raiding party inside the Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘Weird . Why aren’t there any magic beasts?’</p>
<p>If it was an ordinary Dungeon, there should’ve been corpses of magic beasts from the entrance all the way to the boss room .  However, she had come across no such corpses . Were all the magic beasts gathered in one place or something? While moving with that in mind,</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>She had finally come across corpses of the magic beasts . </p>
<p>step, step, step</p>
<p>As fitting of an S-rank Fighter-class Hunter, she reached the site of the battle in a blink of an eye . </p>
<p>‘My god!’</p>
<p>Her eyes widened .  The corpses were high orcs .  The high orcs were easily distinguished from ordinary orcs due to their red skin and long tusks . </p>
<p>‘How did Son Gihoon-ssi’s team win against this many high orcs?’</p>
<p>Not only that, it looked like there was no casualties among the Hunters .  If there were, the raiding party would’ve surely retreated from the Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘Did I look down on A-rank and B-rank Hunters too much?’</p>
<p>Perhaps… Looking over the battlefield, it looked like an ordinary clash between Hunters and magic beasts- Wait . </p>
<p>‘What’s this…?’</p>
<p>Cha Haein lowered her body to take a closer look at something she noticed .  Her eyes opened wider . Getting up, she went from corpse to corpse . </p>
<p>‘Here… and here… also here…’</p>
<p>Her suspicions quickly turned to confirmation . </p>
<p>‘How…?’</p>
<p>Did this happen? Almost every high orc corpse had a wound caused by a small and sharp weapon . </p>
<p>‘It’s not enough to be fatal, but…’</p>
<p>It would’ve been more than enough to weaken the high orcs’ combat prowess, and it was clearly done by a single Hunter .  Ultimately, all the other Hunters had to do was finish off the heavily wounded prey . In reality, it was the same as a single Hunter massacring twenty high orcs .  On top of that, she noticed two high orcs that had died in a different fashion . One of them had its head ripped off by a powerful force and another was killed by blunt trauma to the head . </p>
<p>‘Other than these two, someone had single-handedly injured the high orcs so the other Hunters could take them down easily . ’</p>
<p>Was that possible? Even with pride in her speed, Cha Haein was not sure she could do something like that .  And to her knowledge, there was no Assassin-class Hunter wielding daggers in Son Gihoon’s team . </p>
<p>‘Dagger?’</p>
<p>Suddenly, a memory flashed across her head . </p>
<p>That man who stood before the boss room yesterday . </p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo was definitely holding some kind of small weapons in both of his hands . </p>
<p>‘Was it that man?’</p>
<p>As she reached that line of thought, the S-ranker’s head turned sharply towards the interior of the Dungeon .  Somewhere from deep within the Dungeon, a wave, no, a tsunami of magic power that she had never experienced before was pouring out .  The woman’s face darkened . The air itself shook at the magic power . </p>
<p>‘Oh no!’</p>
<p>Cha Haein bit her lips and ran with all her might towards the boss room . </p>
<p>If this was the boss’s magic power, Son Gihoon’s team would be annihilated . </p>
