<h3>Chapter 106: Chapter 106</h3> 
<p>Two Association Presidents, Goh Gun-Hui and Matsumoto Shigeo, sat down while facing each other </p>
<p>On either side of the two men, representatives from the Japanese Hunter's Association and their Korean counterparts, as well as higher-ups from various government departments sat in a row </p>
<p>With the subject matter being what it was, the conference was moving at a brisk pace </p>
<p>"How do you feel about forming a united assault team comprising of top-ranked Japanese and Korean Hunters?". </p>
<p>This explosive suggestion from Matsumoto Shigeo caused the Koreans present to show much surprise on their faces </p>
<p>They were all under the impression that today's conference would be to discuss the reparation Japanese would demand for the damage they had suffered </p>
<p>But then, the Japanese were saying they would voluntarily help with taking care of this headache?. </p>
<p>What kind of jackpot was this?. </p>
<p>The surprised state of the Korean politicians didn't last long, though, as it was soon replaced by the brightened complexions, instead . With the sole exception of one man, that was </p>
<p>Only Goh Gun-Hui maintained a sharp glare as he observed Matsumoto Shigeo </p>
<p>"Are you saying that you wish to attack the nest of the ants by forming an alliance?". </p>
<p>"That is correct . ". </p>
<p>"We're aware that Japan enjoys an abundance of top-ranked Hunters . However, it is still far too dangerous to invade Jeju Island . ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui also added that there were several times more of the monsters to be found on the island compared to two years ago, when the last subjugation effort failed </p>
<p>It was here that Matsumoto Shigeo formed a rather suspicious smile </p>
<p>"It'd prove to be dangerous indeed if we rushed into the enemy's main camp without a proper plan . ". </p>
<p>One of the Korean politicians, utterly hooked by the suggestion from the Japanese that they would help, asked in an expectant manner </p>
<p>"Do you have a good plan in mind?". </p>
<p>"Yes . ". </p>
<p>Matsumoto Shigeo gathered everyone's attention to himself with a quick answer, but then, continued on only after taking a bit of time for himself </p>
<p>"Of course, we have one . ". </p>
<p>With a single command from him, the prepared files matching the exact number of Korean representatives were placed in front of them </p>
<p>"These are all the data compiled from our observation of the ants . ". </p>
<p>While the Koreans attendees of the conference were perusing through the file, Matsumoto Shigeo began his in-depth explanation </p>
<p>"Each ant may be strong enough to rival a high-rank Hunter, but it also possesses a fatal weakness . And that's their short lifespan . ". </p>
<p>Ants could only live for around one year at most </p>
<p>"Which means, if the ant queen is removed from the equation, every ant found on Jeju Island will eventually die out in around one year . ". </p>
<p>"Indeed ". </p>
<p>The Korean attendees nodded their heads as they read the well-researched data </p>
<p>Only the queen needed to be eliminated </p>
<p>That sounded a whole lot more achievable than killing thousands of unrankable monsters that came out of a rank S Gate . However, Goh Gun-Hui's glare remained icy cold </p>
<p>'What a nonsensical notion that is '. </p>
<p>He knew the truth already </p>
<p>He knew that the act of killing one queen was no different than actually trying to kill every single one of the thousands of those monsters </p>
<p>"Are you making this suggestion because you don't know of ants' instincts to sacrifice themselves in order to protect their queen?". </p>
<p>When Goh Gun-Hui pointed this fact out, Matsumoto Shigeo simply smiled and lightly rebutted him </p>
<p>"Of course I know . If we were to kill the queen, we'd most likely have to break through the defensive wall of thousands of ants . ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui's suspicions grew only larger and larger after he saw how relaxed Matsumoto Shigeo's demeanour was </p>
<p>'Just what are they thinking?'. </p>
<p>The corner of Matsumoto Shigeo's lips arched up </p>
<p>"However, what if all of the ants abandon the ant tunnel for some reason?". </p>
<p>The ant queen lived in the deepest part of the ant tunnel . Why would the ants leave the ant tunnel unguarded, when they were supposed to protect the queen as well as the eggs at all cost?. </p>
<p>When questioning expressions formed on the faces of all the Korean representatives, Matsumoto Shigeo opened his mouth to answer their confusion </p>
<p>"There have been . A total of three times . ". </p>
<p>Three times?. </p>
<p>There had been three times where such an event occurred?. </p>
<p>But, besides all that – how did Japan know so intimately about such things in the first place?. </p>
<p>The answer to this question arrived right away </p>
<p>"The ants emptied out of their tunnel to fight, when the Korean Hunters landed on Jeju Island for the subjugation operations three times in the past . ". </p>
<p>"Keu-euhk . ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui tightly clenched his fists resting on his knees </p>
<p>While the Hunters of South Korea risked their lives and fought, the Japanese were covertly spying on them . No one here criticised Japan for not helping South Korea out back then </p>
<p>But regardless, how could they use the misfortune of the neighbouring nation as their research material, and then proudly reveal the results to said neighbour like this?. </p>
<p>A rank S lost his life during the third failed attempt . And besides him, countless others also died . The Association President Goh Gun-Hui had to watch them die from a very close vantage point back then </p>
<p>His clenched fists were trembling hard now </p>
<p>'Mm . ?'. </p>
<p>Sensing that the complexion of Goh Gun-Hui was getting rather suspicious, Japan's best Hunter, Goto Ryuji unleashed his own magical energy </p>
<p>It was a warning – if the other side tried to do something untoward, then this side would also make a move </p>
<p>Attending the conference as Goh Gun-Hui's bodyguard, Woo Jin-Cheol quickly approached the Association President's side </p>
<p>" Sir?". </p>
<p>" I'm okay now . ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui dismissed Woo Jin-Cheol, and the latter quietly stepped back </p>
<p>Regardless of what the Japanese's attitude was like, this presented a golden opportunity to deal with the ants once and for all if their research data proved to be reliable </p>
<p>'I can't afford to let slip such an opportunity because of my personal feelings . '. </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui could only calm his boiling anger inwardly </p>
<p>Once the threatening tension of the conference room dissipated, Matsumoto Shigeo finally got to the main point </p>
<p>"The Japanese Hunters will take on that role . ". </p>
<p>Japan's rank S Hunters would split into several teams and attack Jeju Island from different directions . Ants would rush out to face the intruders, and just like before, the tunnel with ant queen hiding in it would be emptied out </p>
<p>"We wish to ask Korea's top Hunters with the killing of the queen . ". </p>
<p>South Korea's rank S Hunters would sneak into the island using a helicopter, and once they kill off the queen, they escape via a helicopter again </p>
<p>Noisy, noisy </p>
<p>The plan put forward by the Japanese was rather detailed and sounded quite doable, so the Korean representatives began to get heated up from excitement </p>
<p>"If we follow the Japanese plan, do we get to recover Jeju Island?". </p>
<p>"These Japanese b*stards, they have finally showed their hands now that they too have become victims . ". </p>
<p>"This is a great chance . ". </p>
<p>"Let's seize this opportunity and use the Japanese Hunters to reclaim Jeju Island . ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui didn't participate in the heated discussion of the Korean representatives, choosing to quietly mull over Matsumoto Shigeo's suggested plan, instead </p>
<p>'Without a doubt, there is a good chance . '. </p>
<p>There were 21 rank S Hunters in Japan </p>
<p>In comparison, there were only eight in South Korea </p>
<p>But, by excluding himself who couldn't move due to health reasons, or the other Hunter who had to retire early, then realistically speaking, there were only six that could participate </p>
<p>'It'll be impossible to draw and scatter the attention of thousands of ants with that number . '. </p>
<p>In order to do so, they needed Japan and her twenty or so top-ranked Hunters . Even if they were to be split into groups of five, you'd still get four groups, and that would be enough to buy the Koreans time to do their job </p>
<p>But the real problem was, would South Korea's top Hunters actually be able to kill the boss of a rank S dungeon, the ant queen?. </p>
<p>'Is it even possible?'. </p>
<p>It was then, Goh Gun-Hui suddenly remembered the name of Seong Jin-Woo </p>
<p>Seong Jin-Woo was strong enough to solo kill the boss of a rank A dungeon, so what if he worked together with other rank S Hunters?. </p>
<p>Ba-dump, ba-dump . </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui's heart began racing now </p>
<p>'We can't delay this any longer . '. </p>
<p>Currently, ant monsters were evolving at a rapid pace . No one could predict precisely when the entirety of the ant army would become flight-capable . It could be ten years, five, or even, right next year </p>
<p>Before something like that happened, the Koreans had to kill off the dastardly ants, and if they had to resort to borrowing another country's strength, then so be it </p>
<p>But, before that . </p>
<p>"What does Japan want as compensation from this cooperation?". </p>
<p>The Association President Goh Gun-Hui didn't let this important matter slip through </p>
<p>Matsumoto Shigeo did his best to form the most magnanimous smile he could physically perform </p>
<p>"When the rest of ants die in a year, we evenly split the magic crystals left behind on the island . ". </p>
<p>Only that much?. </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui tilted his head, unconvinced </p>
<p>"Will you really be happy with only that?". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui's question caused the Korean government officials and politicians near him to frown rather deeply </p>
<p>'If they are willing to do it for a small asking price, he should just gladly accept it, so why is he questioning them like this?'. </p>
<p>'What will he do if the Japanese decide to change their mind all of a sudden . ?'. </p>
<p>'Association President Goh Gun-Hui, you're still too distrusting, what with your background being a man who used to run a corporation . '. </p>
<p>Their hot dagger-like glares stabbed deeply into Goh Gun-Hui . He had no choice but to shut his mouth </p>
<p>A short discussion took place between the Korean attendees, but no one raised a voice of objection </p>
<p>In the end, the Japanese's proposal was approved unanimously </p>
<p>After the conference successfully came to an end, Matsumoto Shigeo approached Goh Gun-Hui with a beaming smile and offered his right hand </p>
<p>"The future of our two nations depends on this cooperation . Let us combine our resources together and do our best . ". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>After returning to his hotel room, Matsumoto Shigeo placed a cigarette in between his lips . Goto Ryuji to his side lit it up for him </p>
<p>"You worked hard today, sir . ". </p>
<p>"Mister Goto, it's you who worked hard today . ". </p>
<p>"You're praising me too much, sir . ". </p>
<p>"I'm not . Didn't you see Goh Gun-Hui's face back then?". </p>
<p>Matsumoto Shigeo smirked deeply </p>
<p>The fleeting emotion that flickered in and out momentarily on Goh Gun-Hui's face back then – it was definitely rage . The reason why Matsumoto Shigeo was able to display so much leisure in front of a rank S Hunter who reputedly possessed the greatest strength in South Korea, was simple – because, he had a powerful ally standing behind him </p>
<p>And that was Goto Ryuji, Japan's number one melee-type Hunter . And also, the trustworthy right-hand man of the President of the Japanese Hunter Association, Matsumoto Shigeo </p>
<p>Recalling Goh Gun-Hui's expression, Matsumoto formed a mocking smile </p>
<p>"Borrowing the power of someone whom you don't even want to talk to . Now that would be quite intolerable from the perspective of the weak . ". </p>
<p>Goto Ryuji also smirked as well </p>
<p>In the end, the Koreans agreed to work with the Japanese, just as Matsumoto Shigeo had predicted . Everything was moving according to plan </p>
<p>"South Korea is merely the beginning . ". </p>
<p>Matsumoto Shigeo spoke up </p>
<p>"Hunters are the new power, the new political influence . With this power given to Japan, I shall create a new empire . ". </p>
<p>His gaze then shifted over to Goto Ryuji </p>
<p>"And you shall become its next emperor . ". </p>
<p>If Matsumoto Shigeo was to be considered the first ruler of the empire founded on his crafty schemes, then Goto Ryuji would be the second by relying on his powers alone . And this was the reason why Goto Ryuji treated Matsumoto Shigeo as his superior all this time </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>"I almost forgot . ". </p>
<p>Matsumoto Shigeo recalled something and asked Goto Ryuji while killing the cigarette </p>
<p>"Do we still not have any information on South Korea's newest rank S Hunter?". </p>
<p>"Even the South Koreans don't seem to know much about that man, sir . ". </p>
<p>" . Is that so . ". </p>
<p>They already knew everything there was to know regarding all of South Korea's top Hunters . Except for one person </p>
<p>They didn't have a single reliable piece of information on the Hunter who was registered as a rank S recently . The unknown factor could cause deviations to their plan . Now that his ambition had been revealed in full with the commencement of this operation, Matsumoto Shigeo couldn't afford any form of deviation whatsoever to his plan </p>
<p>'Although it is questionable what a single person could achieve on his own, but, still '. </p>
<p>There were five such people in the entire world </p>
<p>They were referred to as Hunters on the rank of 'Special Authority', which meant that each one of them possessed power equalling that of a country's military </p>
<p>They all shared one common point; each one of them had cleared at least one rank S Gate in the past . A Hunter with that kind of ability could easily disrupt his plan </p>
<p>'However, the odds of that are extremely low . '. </p>
<p>Taking into account that there were seven billion people on Earth, the odds would be less than a billion to one . If someone of that calibre appeared, then there was no way the South Koreans would keep quiet about him . But judging from the current atmosphere, there didn't seem to be any cause for concern on that front </p>
<p>'I can't ruin everything by being too cautious here . '. </p>
<p>Matsumoto Shigeo picked up his phone </p>
<p>Then, he gave his command to the higher-ups of his own Association, who were all anxiously waiting for his call back home </p>
<p>"The Koreans have agreed to work with us, so summon all the rank S Hunters as planned . ". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui was also calling the Korean Hunters at that moment </p>
<p>The first priority was to explain the seriousness of the current situation . He was planning to fine-tune the Association's schedule accordingly, but . </p>
<p>"What did you say??". </p>
<p>A completely unexpected piece of news flew out of nowhere and punched him in the face </p>
<p>"You can't get in touch with Hunter Seong Jin-Woo at all???". </p>
<p>For some reason, only Seong Jin-Woo was out of reach </p>
<p>"His phone's been switched off for several days as well, sir . We can't even figure out where he could be . ". </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui shut his mouth tightly then, before opening his mouth . He sounded exasperated at that moment </p>
<p>"In that case, summon the other Hunters excluding him as soon as possible . ". </p>
<p>"Understood, sir . ". </p>
<p>The agent of the Association bowed and quickly ran out of the President's office . Goh Gun-Hui's expression hardened as he fell into deep contemplation </p>
<p>'Where could he possibly be?'. </p>
<p>After hearing the report of Seong Jin-Woo going missing, Goh Gun-Hui suddenly had a foreboding premonition of the future </p>
