<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 30</p>
<p>Jinwoo had expected the inquiry and replied calmly,</p>
<p>“It was just there when I woke up . I don’t know what happened . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol nodded .  Since the day the first Gate appeared 10 years ago, many incredible things had happened in the world .  One of them was the phenomenon of Awakened Beings, now called Hunters . Among the S-rank Healer-class Hunters, there were those that could completely restore the body of a teammate that had their bodies ripped apart .  As long as the victim had a shred of life left in them, they could be made whole . So it wasn’t crazy to think that some high ranking Healer had restored Jinwoo’s leg . </p>
<p>“It wouldn’t have been right for such a young person to become a cripple . Thank goodness for that . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol sighed in relief .  Jinwoo’s eyes moved over to the old man’s left arm .  The sleeve that covered it was clearly empty . Song Chiyeol laughed at his gaze and rubbed his left shoulder . </p>
<p>“Don’t worry about this . It’s normal for a Hunter my age to get into an accident in a Raid . I was just lucky that I got this far before having one . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol spoke to put Jinwoo’s mind at ease, but his words did not reach the onlookers . </p>
<p>“Oh my, that man…”</p>
<p>“How terrible, it must’ve been from a magic beast . ”</p>
<p>The people passing by whispered to each other at the man’s missing arm .  Some children stopped and blatantly stared . </p>
<p>Jinwoo hoped to rescue the man,</p>
<p>“Should we move to somewhere quieter?”</p>
<p>There were too many people walking buy .  Feeling uncomfortable from their gazes, Song Chiyeol nodded in agreement .  There were still few things he wanted to say to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Yes, that would be good . ”</p>
<p>The two men tried to find a small corner to continue their conversation .  While walking, Song Chiyeol noticed something,</p>
<p>‘Sung-ssi’s footsteps…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s footsteps were incredibly light .  Even standing right next to him, Song Chiyeol had difficulty detecting the man’s presence .  How could this be? The veteran Hunter felt that if he and Jinwoo fought in this moment, he could not even touch the young man .  Even if he was a C-ranker, while Jinwoo was an E-ranker . </p>
<p>‘What am I thinking now…’</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol shook his head .  None of that mattered in the moment .  There was something he wanted say to Sung-ssi .  No, it was something that had to be said . Having found a suitable place, Song Chiyeol stopped and Jinwoo followed suit .  Turning around to face him, Song Chiyeol bowed his head to Jinwoo before the young man could stop him . </p>
<p>“Sung-ssi . I have to thank you . ”</p>
<p>As the man who was old enough to be his father bowed to him, Jinwoo became somber .  Even as the young man tried to stop him, Song Chiyeol did not relent and continued with his head lowered . </p>
<p>“Eleven people died because of me . Thanks to you, six of us were able to live . As my responsibility was the heaviest in that place, I thank you on behalf of everyone else . ”</p>
<p>Every word he spoke was out of his heart .  Even Jinwoo was able to feel the man’s sincerity .  It was an unexpected situation, but Jinwoo did not feel bad .  Rather, he felt a twinge of pride . But he could not have an elder bow to him like this forever . </p>
<p>“Ahjussi, please raise your head . ”</p>
<p>At Jinwoo’s pleading words, Song Chiyeol raised his head .  Just then, his phone rang . The old man apologized and turned away to pick it up . </p>
<p>“Got it . I’ll be right there . ”</p>
<p>Ending the call, Song Chiyeol’s face was hardened .  He turned to address Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“I have to go somewhere now . ”</p>
<p>The elder spoke as if he had a private business to take care of, but Jinwoo had already heard the entire conversation through his ears .  Thanks to his raised sense stat, his naturally good hearing was improved even more . The phone call just now was from the Association, who was notifying Song Chiyeol of a Gate that had appeared .  Worrying about the recently discharged Jinwoo, the old man hid this information and was trying to walk away, but Jinwoo had no intention of letting this slip from his hands . </p>
<p>“It was the Association, right?”</p>
<p>“You… you heard all that?”</p>
<p>The Association will call all of its affiliated Hunters in an area in the event of a Raid .  If Song Chiyeol was contacted, surely Jinwoo would’ve been too, if he had his phone . This was the call that Jinwoo had been waiting for . </p>
<p>“I’ll go too . ”</p>
<p>“Young man…”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol’s eyes looking at Jinwoo was quickly filled with defeat . </p>
<p>The two men arrived at the appointed location .  Because the Gate had appeared in a residential area, the police were already around, cordoning off the area .  However, there was little need, as there were no noisy civilians watching . The Gates that the Association ended up taking care of were those on the verge of Dungeon Break, so the people stayed away in case of danger .  Besides, it wasn’t as if they could watch the Hunters battle in the Dungeon anyways . Every now and then, a curious child might approach with mischief, but they would be chased away by the police . </p>
<p>Jinwoo and Song Chiyeol got off the taxi and were stopped by the police . </p>
<p>“Could you please show me your identification?”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol took out his Hunter license from his wallet . </p>
<p>“C-rank Hunter, Song Chiyeol . This is my fellow Hunter, Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>Satisfied, the policeman let the pair through . </p>
<p>“We’re in your care, Hunter-nims . ”</p>
<p>“We’ll do our best . Thank you for your service . ”</p>
<p>After exchanging light greetings, the two began to walk towards the Gate .  Jinwoo walked behind the old man . In front of the Gate, an Association employee was waiting .  It was a young woman with glasses . She approached the pair,</p>
<p>“Hunter Song Chiyeol-nim! Huh? How did Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim get here? You weren’t picking up the phone . ”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol replied for Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“We were together when I got the call . ”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so? We just thought Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim was avoiding the call again . ”</p>
<p>The employee smiled in jest .  A long time ago, she would have been correct .  Having received a major injury during a Raid, Jinwoo once even turned off his phone in fear .  However, he had to eventually relent and show up because refusing the Association’s call three times would result in an expulsion .  Thinking about the past, Jinwoo smiled bittersweetly . </p>
<p>“Ah, right . The other Hunters are already here . Why don’t you go and say hi?”</p>
<p>The employee gestured to the other Hunters .  There were only two of them waiting . After the incident at the Double Dungeon, the number of Hunters in the area had decreased greatly .  According to Song ahjussi, two of the surviving Hunters even chose to retire out of trauma . </p>
<p>‘And Juhee-ssi was one of them…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around but did not see Juhee .  As the two men approached, the Hunters who had arrived before them avoided his gaze .  Jinwoo’s eyes narrowed . </p>
<p>‘Of course…’</p>
<p>It was two of the men who had abandoned him back in the underground temple, Kim Sangshik and the man who cast aside Jinwoo’s injured body to the ground .  It made sense that they were avoiding him . </p>
<p>“Er, Sung-ssi…”</p>
<p>Kim Sangshik gathered his courage and tried to make a late greeting but was rebuffed by Jinwoo’s cold eyes . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The man closed his mouth and walked away .  From a distance away, he looked at Jinwoo and tilted his head . </p>
<p>‘Is that human really the Sung Jinwoo that I knew? His eyes were fierce like a magic beast’s…’</p>
<p>Kim Sangshik’s body shuddered .  His arms were covered in goosebumps .  It was not his fault, Jinwoo had lightly applied a killing intent in his gaze .  Thankfully, the man had taken the hint and avoided him . Jinwoo had hoped he would continue to do so going forward . </p>
<p>“Sung-ssi,”</p>
<p>Song Chiyeol, who was standing next to Jinwoo, suddenly smiled . </p>
<p>“There she comes . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo started turning his head towards where the elder was gesturing, but before he fully could,</p>
<p>“Jinwoo-ssi!”</p>
<p>Something soft hugged him tightly . </p>
<p>“Juhee-ssi?”</p>
<p>As Jinwoo panicked, Juhee examined his body with tears in her eyes . </p>
<p>“Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere? Your leg! How is your leg-?”</p>
<p>Juhee looked back and forth between Jinwoo’s face and legs with surprise .  The magnitude was different, but her response was the same as Song Chiyeol . </p>
<p>“Ah, that’s…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s explanation was interrupted by a loud voice,</p>
<p>“Ah, young love! Hot hot hot!”</p>
<p>A man in prisoner’s uniform was whistling towards them, having just gotten out of a car . </p>
<p>‘Are they filming a movie nearby?’</p>
<p>As Jinwoo stared with confusion, a man wearing a suit got out of the passenger seat of the car .  The man gave a stern warning to the prisoner,</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth . ”</p>
<p>The prisoner avoided his gaze and looked away .  While the man in the suit turned back to the car, the prisoner winked at Juhee .  Jinwoo’s forehead furrowed . From the car, two additional men got out . They were all wearing a prisoner’s uniform and handcuffed .  The man in the suit led the three prisoners towards the Association employee and greeted her . </p>
<p>“You’re finally here . ”</p>
<p>“Sorry . There was a little traffic on the way . ”</p>
<p>The Association employee handed the man some papers, and he began to sign them one by one .  Meanwhile, the Association employee called over all the Hunters . </p>
<p>“These men are prisoners on a work-release program[1] that will be going with the Hunter-nims into the Raid . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters’ expressions darkened .  Kim Sangshik stepped forward,</p>
<p>“Prisoners on work-release? You’re telling us to Raid with criminals?”</p>
<p>Hunters who had committed crimes had two choices .  Fulfill their sentences away in a prison or cooperate with the Association and reduce their sentences .  Most chose the latter . These criminals would be on “work-release” . The employee apologetically bowed before the Hunters . </p>
<p>“I really have to apologize . The number of Hunters in our area had decreased too drastically . The Association said we had no choice for the time being . Thankfully, a Hunter from the Hunter Surveillance Department will be accompanying you, so you shouldn’t have to worry . ”</p>
<p>Kim Sangshik asked suspiciously,</p>
<p>“The HSD Hunter will be going with us too?”</p>
