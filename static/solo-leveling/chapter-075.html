<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 75</p>
<p>On that crossroad in the past, Jinwoo had selected the Blessed Random Box over the Cursed Random Box .  It was from that Blessed Random Box that he had obtained the Demon Castle Key . Through that key, he had earned many things .  Level-ups, new items, and… so much gold that he was starting to worry if he had to start spending it . </p>
<p>‘Even if the same choice was presented to me, I would pick the Blessed Random Box . ’</p>
<p>However, that didn’t mean that he was not curious about what the other choice would have resulted in .  The blessed box that would give him what he “wanted”, and the cursed box that would give him what he “needed” .  Just what was the thing that he “needed” from the cursed box?</p>
<p>‘The Blessed Random Box certainly had what I wanted . ’</p>
<p>And now, Jinwoo had the opportunity to finally satisfy his curiosity . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo waited for the System’s reply with an anxious heart .  For some reason, the System appeared to be more delayed in its response than usual . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<p>Abating his worries, the System’s reply came a moment later,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve chosen the “Cursed Random Box” . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The chosen item will now be provided . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>A small box appeared in front of his feet . </p>
<p>‘Alright!’</p>
<p>With a shaking heart, Jinwoo picked up the box .  He was shocked when he picked it up; its weight was very familiar to him . </p>
<p><strong>Could it be?</strong>.  . </p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly opened the box .  His eyes were widened . </p>
<p>“ . This is?”</p>
<p>After leaving the Demon Castle, Jinwoo quickly headed home .  The first thing he wanted to do was wash-up . It was a luxury not afforded while being in the Dungeon for a week .  Although he could obtain water from the System’s shop, he had neither the time nor the place to clean his body . </p>
<p>‘After all, showering while being in a place packed with monsters is a bit…’</p>
<p>splash-</p>
<p>Feeling the heat of the water wash over his body, the Hunter finally felt like he had left the Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘This is why home is the best . ’</p>
<p>After showering, Jinwoo had changed into a fresh set of clothes and sat on the bed with a wet towel draped over his head .  It was time to review some things . First, he pulled up the status screen . </p>
<p>‘Status screen . ’</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>Screens filled with enough words to spin one’s eyes appeared .  Jinwoo’s gaze stopped at the stat screen . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Available stat points: 20</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The bonus stat points from the quest was neatly waiting for his decision .  Of course, Jinwoo put it all into intelligence . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p> .  . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>.   </p>
<p>Strength: 178</p>
<p>Constitution: 137</p>
<p>Agility: 147</p>
<p>Intelligence: 149</p>
<p>Sense: 119</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Finally, intelligence began to overtake the other stats .  It was not quite at the strength stat’s level, but compared to the past, it had made an amazing progress . </p>
<p>Strength, Constitution, Agility, Intelligence, Sense . </p>
<p>A balance was forming across the attributes . </p>
<p>‘There are no wasted stats . ’</p>
<p>Before he knew it, he underwent periods where he had solely invested into a single attribute .  Periods where he had solely invested into strength, periods where he had solely invested into agility, and lately, the period where he had solely invested into intelligence .  Now, he fully understood that each stat had its own benefits and uses . </p>
<p>‘You know…’</p>
<p>Now that he had reached this point, what if he just distributed his points evenly across the board from now on?</p>
<p>An All-Stat Player . </p>
<p>A desire for something like that appeared in Jinwoo’s mind .  It was a rather happy quandary, born out of knowing that not a single attribute was useless . </p>
<p>‘Once intelligence reaches the level of strength, let’s raise the other stats accordingly . ’</p>
<p>Having made his decision, Jinwoo turned to the skill screen .  The third reward was in that space . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Reward 3 . Unknown Reward</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Because of just how great the first and second rewards were, Jinwoo had not paid much attention to this unknown third reward, having looked at it with a passing curiosity .  Still, he was not a man to ignore any reward given to him . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Reward 3 will now be provided . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>What appeared in his hand with the message was a scroll, similar to the Entry Permits from the Demon Castle . </p>
<p>‘What’s this?’</p>
<p>Surprised at the reward giving him an unexpected item, Jinwoo unfurled the scroll . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Recipe: Holy Water of Life [1]</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Learn how to craft the “Holy Water of Life” . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>‘I can make an item myself?’</p>
<p>Only the Mage-class Awakened Beings could make weapons with magic power… Oh wait, he was technically a Mage-class now . </p>
<p>‘Still, to think that I can make an item if I just have the recipe…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo heart began to race .  At the same time, a question appeared in his mind .  Just what exactly could he make?</p>
<p>‘What’s a Holy Water of Life?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo read over the item information of Holy Water of Life on the recipe scroll . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Holy Water of Life</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: S</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Consumable</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Heal any and every illness . </strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Effects will only be shown after a full bottle is used . </strong>.   </p>
<p>It is a divine potion filled with a powerful magic to cure every sickness . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Cure… every sickness?’</p>
<p>The moment he read the words, Jinwoo thought of his mother in the hospital .  Through his experiments with Yoo Jinho, Jinwoo knew that potions can be used on other people .  If he could truly obtain this Holy Water of Life, it meant that he could save his mother . The hands that held the scroll trembled in excitement .  The ingredients were simple . </p>
<p>‘Fragment of the World Tree . ’</p>
<p>Was obtained after killing Volkhan on the 50th Floor . </p>
<p>‘The Spring Water from the Echoing Forest’ [2]</p>
<p>Was obtained after killing Metus on the 75th Floor . </p>
<p>And the last ingredient . </p>
<p>‘ . The Purified Blood of the Demon King . ’ [3]</p>
<p>This was the only item he had not obtained yet .  However, looking at the floors he had gotten the two ingredients, it was clear to him where the last would come from . </p>
<p>The top of the tower . </p>
<p>‘It’ll probably come from the final boss of the Demon Castle on the 100th Floor . ’</p>
<p>As such, clearing the Demon Castle Dungeon would net him all the ingredients to craft the Holy Water of Life . </p>
<p>It was in this moment Jinwoo realized,</p>
<p>“Ah . ”</p>
<p>He uttered without thinking .  The shock of his realization was that great .  </p>
<p>What if… the thing that he “wanted” from the Blessed Random Box was this Holy Water of Life?</p>
<p>‘Mother…’</p>
<p>His eyes glistened with tears at the thought of seeing his mother healthy again . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You may learn a crafting skill through Recipe: Holy Water of Life </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to learn the crafting skill?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>At the electronic tone, Jinwoo snapped back to reality .  To craft the Holy Water of Life, he had to succeed in conquering the Demon Castle .  In order to accomplish that, he had to quickly obtain the proper raiding gear and return .  There was no time to be lost in his feelings . </p>
<p>“ . Teach me . ”</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve learned how to make Holy Water of Life</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘This is not a dream, is it?’</p>
<p>As if reminding him, the skill screen now showed a section for crafting skills . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Crafting Skills</strong>.   </p>
<p>-Consumable: Holy Water of Life (2/3)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The numbers at the end probably referred to the number of ingredients he had on hand . </p>
<p>‘Oh right . Forgot about this . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo took out an item next to the Spring Water in the inventory .  It was a necklace made out of skulls of small animals . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Monarch of Demons’ Necklace</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: S</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Accessory</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Agility +20, Intelligence +20</strong>.   </p>

<p>  1 . The Monarch of Demons’ Earrings</p>
<p>  2 . The Monarch of Demons’ Necklace</p>
<p><strong>  3 . The Monarch of Demons’ Ring</strong>.   </p>
<p>Set Bonus:</p>
<p>  1 . ??? (2 Items)</p>
<p>  2 . ??? (3 Items)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The Spring Water from the Echoing Forest wasn’t the only thing he had earned from the Guide of Souls .  He had also obtained this rather distasteful looking necklace filled with bad vibes . </p>
<p>‘Why are all these necklaces like this…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s face scrunched at thinking about the dog collar he was “wearing” right now .  He held the Monarch of Demons’ Necklace to his neck . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to replace the “Gatekeeper’s Necklace” with the “Monarch of Demons’ Necklace”?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The boost from the two items were pretty similar .  Both of them increased two stats by 20 . However, the new item had a set effect . </p>
<p>‘Exchange’</p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The “Monarch of Demons’ Necklace” has been equipped . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The skull necklace disappeared and was replaced with a dog collar in Jinwoo’s hand .  He put away the dog collar into his inventory and checked the set bonus of the Crown Jewels of the Monarch of Demons . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Monarch of Demons’ Necklace</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td>  <p><strong> . </strong>.   </p>
<p>Set Bonus:</p>
<p>  1 . All Stats +5 (2 Items)</p>
<p>  2 . ??? (3 Items)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘All stats increased by five . ’</p>
<p>Just a single set bonus was equivalent to increasing his levels by five, and there was still one set bonus remaining . </p>
<p>‘The Monarch of Demons’ Ring…’</p>
<p>Usually in video games, the set bonuses became better and better as you equipped more items in the set .  In that line of thinking, the unrevealed set bonus should be something crazy . </p>
<p>Still, the S-rank equipments he had earned were but the side benefits of his time spent in the Demon Castle . </p>
<p>The true benefit was the great leap he had made in his levels .  Jinwoo looked at the progress he made while climbing 77 floors and smiled . </p>
<p>‘I went up 16 levels in one week . ’</p>
<p>It was a speed unthinkable in the C-rank Dungeons .  This was the result of his efforts spent in the wild(?) for seven days .  Of course, he still had business left in the place, but the Demon Castle Raid was an incredible success . </p>
<p>‘But there’s this…’</p>
<p>One thing he could not understand .  Jinwoo held the item from the Cursed Random Box under the light from a lamp . </p>
<p>‘What is this?’</p>
<p>It was a black key that seemed to absorb all light .  No information box popped when he stared at it . </p>
<p>‘I’ve never had the information box not pop up from an item from the System…’</p>
<p>Just Instant Dungeon Keys were rare enough from normal Random Boxes, but he had never seen something like this before . </p>
<p>‘Where do I even use this?’</p>
<p>Because it was an item from a “cursed” box, he did feel a little anxious holding it .  Still, it was something that had been earned with effort, so he couldn’t just throw it away . </p>
<p>‘I’m sure I’ll find a use for it someday . ’</p>
<p>After all, the Cursed Random Box did say it’ll give him something he needed . </p>
<p>Returning the key back to the inventory, Jinwoo stood up .  Now, he had to focus on obtaining artifacts to help clear the Demon Castle . </p>
<p>‘And there’s something I want to sell . ’</p>
<p>However, the problem was that an E-rank Hunter could not easily buy or sell high-level artifacts .  If a low-ranking Hunter (and Jinwoo was known to be the weakest) put up an item for auction (an item that even high-rankers would be pressed to obtain), who wouldn’t be suspicious of him? Same goes for buying .  With the title of “E-rank Hunter” attached to him, it was hard for Jinwoo use the funds he had amassed . </p>
<p>‘It’ll be hard to explain where I want to use the artifacts too . ’</p>
<p>And so, he had to overcome this awkward situation . </p>
<p>“Is it time…”</p>
<p>Time to cast aside the facade of the E-rank . </p>
<p>Ranking Retest . </p>
<p>It was time for him to earn his true ranking .  </p>
<p>The Hunter’s expression became serious . </p>
<p>‘At my current level, I probably won’t be used by others against my will . ’</p>
<p>From the start, that was one of the objectives of leveling up .  To prevent a stronger power from forcing him under their control, Jinwoo had masqueraded as an E-ranker . </p>
<p>But now? He was able to stand face to face against Baekho’s Guildmaster Baek Yoonho .  No, even if it wasn’t Baek Yoonho, he was confident that he could remain strong in front of anyone .  There was no longer any reason to hide his powers . </p>
<p>ba dum, ba dum, ba dum</p>
<p>Thinking about throwing away that annoying title of “E-rank” that plagued his past, Jinwoo’s heart began to beat faster . </p>
<p>‘Before that,’</p>
<p>There was one thing he had to check .  Jinwoo turned on his Hunter phone . After a week of no contact, his phone was filled with missed calls and messages .  Most of them were unknown numbers . He felt sorry, but he did not particularly want to check who they were . </p>
<p>‘If it’s urgent, I’m sure they’ll call again . ’</p>
<p>With a cool mind, he kept going down the call history and found the number he wanted .  Jinwoo called the number . </p>
<p>[Follow me~]</p>
<p>Before the song even finished a verse, the person on the other end picked up the phone with an incredible speed . </p>
<p>- “Hyungnim!”</p>
<p>Was he in the Dungeon for that long? To think that this brat’s voice would sound so welcoming .  Jinwoo smiled and opened his mouth,</p>
<p>“Did the talk with your father go well?”</p>
<p>- “Yes! It went well, hyungnim!”</p>
<p>‘Oh yeah?’</p>
<p>That was good to hear .  Jinwoo did not want to take the retest while Yoo Jinho and his father’s deal was not completed .  And if their side was all good, he had no problems anymore . He had guessed that Yoo Jinho’s happy greeting meant good news, but hearing it from the young man’s mouth gave him the assurance he needed . </p>
<p>- “Hyungnim! I was actually going to go see you about-”</p>
<p>click . </p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>The call was suddenly ended .  Jinwoo checked his phone; it had died because the battery ran out . </p>
<p>‘Well… I did forget to charge it before going into the Demon Castle . ’</p>
<p>Still, it was good that he was able to confirm Yoo Jinho had succeeded .  Jinwoo changed his clothes . The Association HQ was not far from here . He could finish the retest in an instant . </p>
<p>“Oh right . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was half way out of the door and quickly came back in .  He forgot about his little sister . She would probably worry if her brother, who said he’d be home after a week, left the house again without a word .  He left a brief note on the kitchen table . </p>
<p>[Oppa came home and left . ]</p>
<p>With a satisfied smile, Jinwoo left the house . </p>
<p>It had been a long time since Jinwoo had stood before the Awakened Being Ranking Test Office . </p>
<p>‘Has it been four years?’</p>
<p>Maybe five? With a nostalgic face, Jinwoo walked up to the employee at the reception desk .  The employee didn’t even look up,</p>
<p>“Your proof of identity and contact information please . ”</p>
<p>Remembering how the proceedings went last time, Jinwoo put down the documents he had already prepared . </p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>The employee looked at Jinwoo’s proof of identity and tilted his head,</p>
<p>“This is a Hunter’s License . ”</p>
<p>“Yep . ”</p>
<p>The employee looked confused,</p>
<p>“If you have any complaints about the results of your rank, that’s for a different office . ”</p>
<p>“No, I’m here for a retest . ”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The employee looked back and forth between Jinwoo’s face and the license then put up a finger,</p>
<p>“O-one moment . ”</p>
<p>The employee stood up and went behind him to a middle-aged man who looked like he had a temper . </p>
<p>“Deputy, some Hunter came here for a retest, what should I do?”</p>
<p>“Retest? What’s his current rank?”</p>
<p>“E-rank, sir . ”</p>
<p>The deputy looked behind the employee at Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“It happens from time to time . Deluded Hunters who come here, unable to accept their reality . ”</p>
<p>“So you think that man is?”</p>
<p>The deputy nodded,</p>
<p>“Reawakened my ass… He’s just unable to accept the fact that other Hunters earn a ton and are more famous than him . ”</p>
<p>“Ah . ”</p>
<p>“People like that become a headache if you entertain them for too long . Just tell him that he’ll have to pay the retest fee and send him to the testing building . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . ”</p>
<p>Having rid of his worries, the employee returned to the reception desk .  The deputy stared at the employee and Jinwoo and clicked his tongue, then returned his gaze to his computer .  Suddenly, the deputy’s fingers stopped . That Hunter’s name… He felt like he had heard it before . </p>
<p>‘Where was it?’</p>
<p>After the man disappeared off to the testing building, he quietly went up to the employee . </p>
<p>“That E-rank Hunter just now, what was his name?”</p>
<p>“It was Sung Jinwoo . Do you know him?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so . ”</p>
<p>But the deputy couldn’t shake the feeling he had heard of the name before .  Combing over his memories, he suddenly realized and widened his eyes . </p>
<p>‘Ah!’</p>
<p>That man had asked him! To let him know if a Hunter named Sung Jinwoo came to the testing office .  Why didn’t he remember?! The deputy disappeared to a corner and quickly called someone . </p>
<p>ring, ring</p>
<p>- “Hello, this is Baek Yoonho . ” [4]</p>
<p>“Ah, Guildmaster Baek . It’s about that Hunter you asked about before . That Hunter Sung Jinwoo . He really came here . I mean, how did you know he would come?”</p>
<p>- “Sung Jinwoo-ssi came to the testing office?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he just requested a retest just now . ”</p>
<p>- “ . ”</p>
<p>The deputy thought the call was ended, but a moment later, an urgent voice continued across the phone,</p>
<p>- “Could you please delay his testing, even for a little bit? I’ll be right there . ”</p>
<p>The deputy tilted his head . </p>
<p>Was he mistaken? That Baekho’s Guildmaster’s voice sounded anxious . </p>
<p>‘What a strange day . ’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the matter was already out of his hands .  The deputy scratched his temple and replied,</p>
<p>“Er… He already left for the testing building . ”</p>
<p> .  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Recipe: Holy Water of Life” (도안: 생명의 신수): two parts here to go over,</p>
<p>1 . “Recipe” (도안): lit . “design” . “Design” is probably more appropriate in context of learning new crafting items, but I went with “recipe” since the crafting item in question is a consumable . </p>
<p>2 . “Holy Water of Life” (생명의 신수): “life” 생명 + “god” 신 + “water” 수 . Closest cultural approximation of “god water” (신수) is the ceremonial water used in certain east asian religious rites, so I decided to go with “holy water” . </p>
<p>[2]: “Spring Water from the Echoing Forest” (메아리 숲의 샘물): quite literal . “Echo” 메아리 + “forest” 숲 + “spring water” 샘물</p>
<p>[3]: “Purified Blood of the Demon King” (정화된 악마왕의 피): quite literal . “Purified” 정화된 + “demon king” 악마왕 + “blood” 피 . Please note that this is one of the reasons why I translated 군주 as “Monarch” and not “King” . It’s because the word 왕 (“King”) exists, and that word can only be really used for “King” . </p>
<p>[4]: corrected a mistake on the original .  Baek Yoonho’s name is written as Baek Yoonhob . :P</p>
