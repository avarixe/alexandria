<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 48</p>
<p>Kooong-!</p>
<p>The doors of the boss room opened .  Inside of the room was dark . Even with his raised sense stat, it was hard for Jinwoo to see inside .  All that he could see was the front of his feet . The floor was neatly lined with stone slabs . The grey stones gave off a cold feeling compared to the heat of his body . </p>
<p>The moment he took a step onto those slabs,</p>
<p>flaaare-!</p>
<p>The numerous torches that lined the interior of the room all lit up, illuminating the area . </p>
<p>‘As I thought… it’s the same as the underground temple . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo could not lower his guard .  He cautiously walked while observing his surroundings .  The sides of the room contained giant pillars, and at the deep end of the room was a large throne . </p>
<p>‘This reminds me of…’</p>
<p>It was reminiscent of a king’s throne room that he saw in a movie .  Well, the scale was quite different . </p>
<p>After he had taken few steps into the room, the door behind him closed with a loud sound . </p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>He took a glance back but did not panic .  He had already predicted as much . He continued forward . </p>
<p>‘ . I sense a strong presence . ’</p>
<p>He felt that to finish the class advancement quest, he would have to reach the throne ahead .  That kind of thinking had mostly worked out so far, but he was wrong this time . </p>
<p>As he neared the throne, an armored form hidden behind a pillar revealed itself and slowly walked in front of him, blocking his path .  </p>
<p>step step</p>
<p>stop . </p>
<p>The thing stopped and turned to face Jinwoo . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>He knew this was the boss .  Its name in red letters, floating above its head, told him as much . </p>
<p>‘Knight Captain, Blood-red Ygritte’ [1]</p>
<p>It was a knight wearing a red armor .  The armor part was same as the knights he had faced before, but compared to those lumbering enemies, this one looked a lot more agile .  What stood out to Jinwoo was its helmet . The top of the helmet was adorned with a plumage . It was a streak of red hair that started from the top of the helmet and fell backwards, looking like a horse’s tail .  While looking over the helmet, Jinwoo noticed something else,</p>
<p>‘He… he has eyes?’</p>
<p>Or rather, in the spot where a person’s eyes should be, the opening of the helmet glowed with two silver lights .  Its “eyes” were reminiscent of light coming from a machine and gave off a sense of coldness . Those eyes were looking at Jinwoo .  It raised the hair on the back of his neck . </p>
<p>‘So this was the owner of the powerful presence…’</p>
<p>Perhaps defeating it was the goal of the class advancement quest .  If that was the case, Jinwoo had to be careful . He kept an eye on Ygritte’s movements and raised his fists . </p>
<p>‘Dagger won’t work anyways . ’</p>
<p>What was needed to defeat a knight was destructive power .  He would need his strength . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Ygritte was watching Jinwoo, then suddenly removed its red cape . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>The cape fell onto the ground . </p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Its strange behavior did not stop there . </p>
<p>The knight took out the longsword and the two daggers at its sides and threw them on to the floor, one at a time .  It was a slow, deliberate act, sending a message to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>clang . </p>
<p>clang . clang . </p>
<p>The silence of the boss room was broken by the loud sounds of the metal falling onto the stone slabs .  Having discarded his weapons, Ygritte raised his fists and took a fighting stance, imitating the Hunter . </p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>‘Is this bastard…’</p>
<p>Was he going to fight him in a hand-to-hand combat because Jinwoo did not take out a weapon? The Hunter bit his lips . </p>
<p>‘ . Looking down on me?’</p>
<p>The monster had succeeded in taunting Jinwoo without using a skill .  However, Jinwoo maintained his focus . The angrier he got, the more he cooled himself .  Compared to the increasing speed of his heartbeat, Jinwoo’s eyes shone with sharpness . </p>
<p>‘Come . ’</p>
<p>As if reading his mind, Ygritte charged at him in a straight line . </p>
<p>step, step, step, step!</p>
<p>It was an unthinkable speed for an armored being . </p>
<p>‘My armor said strength below eighty resulted in a movement penalty . ’</p>
<p>That meant the opponent’s strength was at least 80! On top of that, the knight’s movements revealed that his agility was not at all below a high-ranking Hunter . </p>
<p>Ygritte came before Jinwoo and leaped . </p>
<p>Step!</p>
<p>The knight aimed a knee at Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘He’s fast!’</p>
<p>But Jinwoo was not about to lose in speed .  He bent his body backwards in a near 90-degree angle and dodged Ygritte’s attack .  He quickly raised his body and turned to face the boss . Unlike the knights that lost to their momentum and continued after missing their charge, Ygritte immediately turned around after landing . </p>
<p>Koong!</p>
<p>There was no time to be impressed by his clean movements .  Jinwoo quickly ran to Ygritte before he fully turned around and aimed a kick at his face .  However, even while turning around, the knight accurately moved his arm . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s right leg was easily stopped by Ygritte’s left hand . </p>
<p>‘Impossible!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was surprised .  While Jinwoo’s leg was still off the ground, Ygritte’s fist flew straight toward him . </p>
<p>woosh-!</p>
<p>The Hunter reflexively put up both arms to guard but could not completely block the impact . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The punch broke through his guard, and Jinwoo felt his body tossed into the air . </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo exclaimed in shock but the sound from his mouth quickly turned to a groan . </p>
<p>“ . ?”</p>
<p>Ygritte was already right before his eyes .  Before he could react, Jinwoo’s face was greeted by the knight’s left fist . </p>
<p>Smash!</p>
<p>The Hunter bounced on the ground and rolled across the room . </p>
<p>tiiiiiiing-</p>
<p>When he finally stopped and got up, Jinwoo’s ears were ringing .  He shook his head few times and the ringing eased up a bit . However, there was a bigger problem approaching .  Through his blurred vision, Jinwoo saw Ygritte walking towards him . </p>
<p>step step</p>
<p>Jinwoo opened his eyes wide and focused strength into his legs .  Ygritte stopped at an arm’s reach before him . </p>
<p>A slugfest began between the pair . </p>
<p>Ygritte did not make any attempts to dodge Jinwoo’s attacks .  He took the man’s fist and counterattacked with his own . </p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The knight’s head turned slightly .  Even before Jinwoo’s hand retracted after punching, the knight struck with a blinding speed . </p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s body swayed . </p>
<p>Smash!</p>
<p>This time, Ygritte took a step backwards . </p>
<p>Bash!</p>
<p>The knight’s fists struck Jinwoo’s stomach, and the Hunter bent over . </p>
<p>“cough!”</p>
<p>Blood came out of the man’s mouth . </p>
<p>‘So much for physical damage reduction…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s physical damage reduction was at a whopping 30% with his equipment .  But each of Ygritte’s punches hurt like a hammer slamming into on him . On the other hand, his own attacks did not seem to do much damage to the knight .  The pair’s exchange did not last long . </p>
<p>Smash!</p>
<p>Shaking, Jinwoo finally took a knee . </p>
<p>thud . </p>
<p>He tried to rise again but could not find the strength . </p>
<p>thud . </p>
<p>“Grrl…”</p>
<p>Ygritte stood before Jinwoo and stopped his attacks .  The knight stared down at the man . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>The crimson figure ignored the eyes looking at him with confusion and stretched a hand towards the sword in the distance .  The knight’s sword flew across the air into his hand . Jinwoo realized what Ygritte was going to do . </p>
<p>‘You want to execute me, is that it?’</p>
<p>It truly deserved its title of “Knight Captain” .  When Jinwoo did not particularly make any movements to resist, Ygritte raised his sword to behead the Hunter .  The sword fell in a straight line towards the man’s neck . </p>
<p>However, Jinwoo had no intention of going that easily . </p>
<p>slash-</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s left hand shot up and blocked the falling blade . </p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>It made an unexpected sound of metal striking metal! The gauntlet that he had earned before coming here had protected his hand . </p>
<p>!</p>
<p>He felt Ygritte’s shock .  Not missing the opportunity, Jinwoo’s threw his right fist at the knight .  As expected, Ygritte did not show any indication that he would dodge . </p>
<p>‘You’re just going to counterattack again, right?’</p>
<p>The monster’s calculation was to exchange blow for blow .  However, there was something that was not included in his calculation . </p>
<p>‘Casaka’s Poisoned Fang!’</p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>In an infinitesimal moment, the fist that was flying towards Ygritte’s face was holding the summoned dagger .  Jinwoo dug his dagger into the knight’s eyes . </p>
<p>Stab!</p>
<p>Kuwaaaaaah!</p>
<p>An inhuman scream spilled forth from the helmet .  At the same time, the eyes struck by Jinwoo’s dagger shone with a powerful light .  Jinwoo stood up . </p>
<p>‘Now what?’</p>
<p>The battle was not over just because he took one eye .  He needed something more powerful . A memory flashed across Jinwoo’s mind .  That attack that nearly killed him in the past! Let’s use that again Ygritte .  His body moved before his mind could give the order . Jinwoo lowered his body and hugged Ygritte’s waist .  He started running . </p>
<p>Kuwaaaaak!</p>
<p>While thrashing about in pain, Ygritte repeatedly struck Jinwoo’s back .  The man clenched his teeth and did not let go of the knight . Instead, he raised his speed . </p>
<p>“Sprint!”</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your movement speed is increased by 40% .  </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The Hunter’s legs moved faster .  He reached a speed where his entire body was shaking . </p>
<p>‘Yes, like this . ’</p>
<p>He would slam him into the wall with this speed!</p>
<p>Jinwoo did not ease up on the strength that was holding the knight’s waist and ran with all of his might towards the wall .  Of course, he knew that the damage to his own body would not be minimal at this speed, but Jinwoo had a passive skill as a trump card . </p>
<p>He was almost there! The wall was just ahead . </p>
<p>Kuang-!</p>
<p>SLAM!</p>
<p>With a scream, Ygritte was slammed into the wall .  At the same time, a System message appeared . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your health has fallen below 30% .  ‘Unyielding Spirit’ has been activated . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>All damage received is reduced by 50% . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The shock of the attack was powerful enough to shake the entire room . </p>
<p>“Kuuk . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo took a step back .  Even stuck to the wall, Ygritte was still alive .  Jinwoo felt the blazing lifeforce emanating from the knight . </p>
<p>‘ . I have to end it . ’</p>
<p>He removed Casaka’s Poisoned Fang from where it was stuck .  Ygritte’s body flinched as he took the dagger . Jinwoo grabbed the dagger like an ice pick and brought it down at the knight’s neck . </p>
<p>‘Vital Stab!’</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The attack did not pierce . </p>
<p>One more time . </p>
<p>‘Vital Stab!’</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Sparks flew from the dagger’s tip .  A small scratch appeared in the armor . </p>
<p>Again . </p>
<p>‘Vital Stab!’</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Again . </p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Again . </p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>And finally . </p>
<p>‘Vital Stab!’</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Casaka’s Poisoned Fang dug itself deep into the knight’s neck . </p>

<p>Jinwoo raised his arms high into the air .  While walking backwards, he lost the strength in his legs and fell to the ground . </p>
<p>“pant, pant . ”</p>
<p>He panted like he was about to throw up .  This was a barely obtained victory . It was an incredibly close fight . </p>
<p>‘So… is that it? Am I done with the quest?’</p>
<p>After trying to collect his breath for some time, Jinwoo finally got up with difficulty .  He had expected the class advancement quest to finish after defeating Ygritte, but no messages appeared .  Looking around, nothing had really changed . Well, there was one thing . There were several streaks of light coming from Ygritte’s body .  It was the calling card of items . </p>
<p>‘Let’s grab those first . ’</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure what was about to happen next .  He judged that he should grab what he could for now .  Jinwoo stretched a hand towards the light . </p>

<p>Why was there so many? Jinwoo was suspicious but could not hide his happiness . </p>
<p>‘Acquire all . ’</p>
<p>The leather pouch was the first to be obtained . </p>

<p>Jinwoo was taken back . </p>
<p>‘The reward is in a different class . ’</p>
<p>As expected, the difficulty in taking down the boss resulted in a great reward .  Even the leather pouch, which he did not have much expectations on, gave him an insane amount of gold .  This would be quite useful for the shop . However, Jinwoo was more interested in the other items . If just the leather pouch gave him this much, just what about the helmet and the Runestone? He opened the information screen on the helmet with an excited heart . </p>

<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Knight Captain, Blood-red Ygritte” (기사단장 핏빛의 이그리트): “knights/knightcorp leader/captain” 기사단장 + “color of blood” 핏빛의 + proper name .  This might be weird, but the korean spelling of its name is exactly the same as Ygritte from Game of Thrones, “Yi” 이 + “Geu” 그 + “Ri” 리 + “Teu” 트 .  Not sure if it’s an homage . The knight is male, however . </p>
<p>[2]: “Ruler’s Hands” (지배자의 손길): “ruler” 지배자 + “touch/hands” 손길</p>
