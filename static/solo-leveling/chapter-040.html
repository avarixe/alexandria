<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 40</p>
<p>- “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting with the phone in hand . Contact me immediately if something happens . ”</p>
<p>- “Understood, chief . ”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin ended the call, then realized he was hungry . </p>
<p>growl</p>
<p>‘Argh, I was too focused on all of this ’</p>
<p>It was already long past lunchtime, but Ahn Sangmin had not eaten, having waited for Sung Jinwoo .  He did not know when Yoo Jinho’s team would arrive, so he had not left the spot . Having some free time now, Ahn Sangmin looked around for a place to eat, then settled on a convenience store . </p>
<p>‘Not that I’m trying to save any money…’</p>
<p>Though no one said anything, he felt weird going into a restaurant alone .  So, he decided to just get a cup ramen at the convenience store . </p>
<p>He poured the hot water and waited 3 minutes, then was about to dig in when his phone rang . </p>
<p>ring ring</p>
<p>“Dammit! Who the hell? I’m trying to eat here!”</p>
<p>Looking at the phone, it was a familiar name . </p>
<p>[My Right Arm]</p>
<p>‘Hyun Gicheol, you son of a…’</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin answered with an annoyed voice,</p>
<p>“Did you really miss my voice that much?”</p>
<p>- “Chief, that’s not it…”</p>
<p>“Then what is it, if you’ve called me for no reason, you’re eating cup ramen for a week . ”</p>
<p>- “That’s not it, chief! The two just came out!”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin, who was about to eat his first bite, froze like a still image of a video . </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>- “Like I said, Yoo Jinho and Sung Jinwoo just came out! Their team’s all preparing to move out!”</p>
<p>He checked his ears .  There was nothing wrong with them .  He quickly checked the time . </p>
<p>“It’s only been thirty minutes . Are they giving up on the Raid?”</p>
<p>- “No… The Gate is closing . ”</p>
<p>How the hell?!</p>
<p>No matter how low the difficulty of a given C-rank Dungeon was, no one could solo clear it in just 30 minutes . </p>
<p>“Check again! Are you sure the Gate is closing?!”</p>
<p>- “Yes, I’m sure . Do you want me to send you a video?”</p>
<p>“ . No, it’s okay . ”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin hung up and stared blankly into the distance . </p>
<p>They cleared a C-rank Dungeon that would take an A-rank Hunter 2 hours to clear in just 30 minutes . </p>
<p>‘Above B-rank my ass…’</p>
<p>Even if he took an objective look at the information so far,</p>
<p>“Above… A-rank…”</p>
<p>This was an unimaginably good fortune . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim, do you have somewhere else to go after this?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? No, why?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen you hunt this fast before . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho was astonished .  He had always known Jinwoo was strong, but today, he seemed stronger than ever . </p>
<p>Well of course . </p>
<p>Jinwoo swallowed a laughter . </p>
<p>‘The magic beasts today were werewolves~’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Wolf Slayer</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>All stats increased by 40% against beast type monsters . </strong>.   </p>
<p>A title given to a hunter experienced in slaying wolves . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The buff of his title worked against the werewolves .  On top of all of the level-ups he had gone through, if the title buff was applied, no C-rank magic beasts could stand against him . </p>
<p>“Whimper!”</p>
<p>“Whiiimper!”</p>
<p>“Yelp!”</p>
<p>Thanks to that, Yoo Jinho had to go from corpse to corpse without stopping, collecting magic cores .  If he had 10 more hands, it wouldn’t have been enough . Jinwoo had to spend 5 healing potions on him because of this .  The young man even had his hunger satiated by the healing potion, so he didn’t even stop to eat . </p>
<p>‘Well, that’s that . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo raised his head .  He felt a presence of someone watching him from somewhere . </p>
<p>‘I don’t sense any magic power, so it’s probably not a Hunter . ’</p>
<p>He looked around but didn’t see anyone suspicious .  Of course, if he wanted, he could find the man with effort .  But not detecting any killing or hostile intent from the man, Jinwoo decided it was not worth the time . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>It could just be nothing . </p>
<p>As if reading his mind, the presence disappeared . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim, what is it?”</p>
<p>“ . It’s nothing . Let’s go . ”</p>
<p>They had no time to waste .  Jinwoo took one last look around the area then got in the passenger seat . </p>
<p>At the second Gate, he did not feel anyone watching him, both before he entered the Gate and after he left it . </p>
<p>‘Was I being too cautious?’</p>
<p>Thankfully, it appeared that it was nothing after all . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho approached him and bowed his head,</p>
<p>“Sorry, hyungnim, this is it for today . The other Gates are too far . ”</p>
<p>“Nothing to be sorry about . ”</p>
<p>It would be a while before the sunset, but because of the two men’s efforts, all the Gates in the area had been closed, so they would have to call it a day . </p>
<p>“You’ve worked hard . ”</p>
<p>“Oh, the one who worked hard is the Raid leader . ”</p>
<p>“I’ll see you tomorrow”</p>
<p>“Thank you, you’ve worked hard . ”</p>
<p>After bidding the other Hunters goodbye, Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho got in the car . </p>
<p>“I’ll drive you home, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>Before he knew it, Yoo Jinho had become a faithful driver .  The image of him holding the handle was rather fitting . Jinwoo blatantly stared at the young man . </p>
<p>‘To think that the young master of a rich household would become a chauffeur, just so he can become a Guildmaster…’</p>
<p>Stepping on the gas with a smile, Yoo Jinho suddenly realized Jinwoo was staring at him . </p>
<p>“Hmm? Is there something on my face, hyungnim?”</p>
<p>“ . No, it’s nothing . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo pretended to not have stared and took out his phone as a distraction . </p>
<p>‘4:46…’</p>
<p>It was too early to go home .  Thankfully, there was something he had to do . </p>
<p>‘It was around here, right?’</p>
<p>“Jinho,”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho skillfully turned the handle around a curve while answering . </p>
<p>“Let’s go to Mirae Mall . ”</p>
<p>“Mirae Mall?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho was surprised . </p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>“Well it is right ahead… You know, you’ve been acting weird all day, hyungnim . Are you sure everything’s alright?”</p>
<p>“ . You know, you’ve been getting rather talkative these days . ”</p>
<p>And with that, Yoo Jinho’s face became fixed on the road . </p>
<p>“I will take you there with the speed of light, hyungnim . Hold onto your belt!”</p>
<p>Changing his attitude in a flash, Yoo Jinho drove the car without braking .  They soon arrived at Mirae Mall . </p>
<p>screech-</p>
<p>The car stopped at their destination .  As a mall at the heart of Seoul, Mirae Mall was quite a spectacle .  Jinwoo got out of the car, and Yoo Jinho followed . The young man closed the door and walked up to Jinwoo’s side . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim, someday, our Guild should use a building like this for our headquarters . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho looked up and down at the mall and made a half-serious joke .  But no one replied . Noticing something was off, Yoo Jinho quickly turned toward where Jinwoo was . </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo had disappeared . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim?”</p>
<p>No matter where he looked, Jinwoo was gone . </p>
<p>“Hyungniiiim?”</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>As the boss was defeated, the Dungeon will return to its normal interior . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Two more levels from the mall’s Instant Dungeon . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s footsteps on the way home were light with joy .  It was the first key he had seen in a while from a Random Box, usable in Mirae Mall .  He had wondered when he would go and clear it, and today, the opportunity presented itself . </p>
<p>“Hyungniiiim?”</p>
<p>Remembering Yoo Jinho call after his disappeared self, Jinwoo stifled a laughter . </p>
<p>ring ring</p>
<p>Jinwoo started to answer his phone out of habit, but stopped when he realized it was a number he had never seen before . </p>
<p>‘Who?’</p>
<p>When he was in highschool, he was busy taking care of his little sister in the place of their mother .  After graduating, he had started work as a Hunter . Because of this, Jinwoo did not know that many people . </p>
<p>‘There shouldn’t be anyone I don’t know calling me…’</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Jinwoo picked up . </p>
<p>“Hello . ”</p>
<p>- “Hello, is this Sung Jinwoo-ssi?”</p>
<p>A clear and well-spoken male’s voice . </p>
<p>Jinwoo immediately hung up . </p>
<p>‘In my experience, 99% of these calls are telemarketing or loan sharks . ’</p>
<p>He was about to put the phone away when it rang again . </p>
<p>ring ring</p>
<p>It was the same number . </p>
<p>‘Hmm? Was it not telemarketing?’</p>
<p>Valuing quantity over quality, telemarketing calls usually did not call again after one attempt .  They knew that it’d be a waste of time . </p>
<p>‘Then this person might really have a reason…’</p>
<p>This time, he properly answered the call . </p>
<p>“Yes, this is Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>- “Ah, I had the right number . I thought I had the wrong one when you just hung up now, haha . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo considered for about 2 seconds whether to explain that he had thought the clear and well-spoken voice belonged to a telemarketer . </p>
<p>‘Feels like apologizing for it might sound more rude…’</p>
<p>Soon, the business employee, or rather, the man who sounded like a business employee introduced himself . </p>
<p>- “Ah, I apologize . I have not introduced myself . I am Ahn Sangmin of the Baekho Guild . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo stopped walking . </p>
<p>‘The Baekho Guild is calling me?’</p>
<p>No matter how he thought about it, the Baekho Guild would not have a reason to call him .  Only possible relation he had with them was the fact that they were the Guild who helped out the Association during the Double Dungeon incident . </p>
<p>‘But I don’t think they’re calling me about that day after all this time . ’</p>
<p>Curiosity was a feeling that invited impatience .  Before Ahn Sangmin could continue, Jinwoo asked,</p>
<p>“Why is the Baekho Guild calling me?”</p>
<p>- “It’s a little hard to explain over the phone, could we come to see you and explain?”</p>
<p>Instead of telling him to come over, they were offering to come to him .  Jinwoo had no reason to refuse . He would have some free time anyways the day after tomorrow . </p>
<p>‘Jinho said he had some event at home?’</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho had explained that there was a big event that required the attendance of the entire family and apologized for not being able to Raid on Thursday . </p>
<p>‘A big event…’</p>
<p>Imagining a chaebol’s family gathering, Jinwoo imagined a party held in some luxurious banquet hall at a top hotel, like in the dramas .  Anyways, he would be free that day . </p>
<p>“I’ll have some free time on Thursday . ”</p>
<p>- “That’s er… Are you free right now?”</p>
<p>Right now?</p>
<p>Jinwoo checked the time .  It was 8 o’ clock . </p>
<p>“It’s almost eight . ”</p>
<p>- “We’re waiting nearby . We just need a moment of your time . ”</p>
<p>“Nearby?”</p>
<p>- “It’s a french cafe . ”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin told him the location .  It was a familiar place . After all, it was the place he had met with Yoo Jinho .  Jinwoo’s eyes became sharp . </p>
<p>‘He knows where I live . ’</p>
