<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 49</p>
<p>This was the first S-rank equipment he had found .  On top of the incredible benefit of reducing physical damage taken by 15%, it also had a powerful effect of giving strength and constitution a 20 point boost .  Jinwoo’s chest pounded in excitement at the item . </p>
<p>‘It’s incomparable to the A-rank equipment . ’</p>
<p>He had obtained 2 A-rank items so far .  The first was Casaka’s Venom Gland from taking down Casaka .  The second was the Gatekeeper’s Necklace from Cerberus . Even those two were plenty powerful .  While the Venom Gland did technically have a penalty on strength, it still was a powerful item that gave him a permanent 20% physical damage reduction .  And the Gatekeeper’s Necklace? It was an amazing item that gave 20 points to both agility and sense . The benefit of those two stats only became more apparent as time passed . </p>
<p>And the “Red Knight’s Helmet” that he obtained had effects that nearly combined those two A-rank items .  And without any penalties . </p>
<p>‘It’s really the best . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo could not help but smile despite of the difficult fight .  There was one more minor thing; he actually liked the design of the helmet . </p>
<p>‘Shame that I won’t be able to show it off . ’</p>
<p>The helmet shone with the color of blood .  Along with the long plumage, it was almost like a work of art .  For a brief moment, Jinwoo would’ve liked to obtain and wear the full set of the crimson armor .  Unfortunately,</p>
<p>‘Regrettable…’</p>
<p>The other pieces of Ygritte’s armor did not appear as drops .  Only the helmet had been obtained . Jinwoo put aside the small regret and carefully put on the helmet . </p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>As always, the item disappeared the moment he equipped it .  Although he could not show off its form, the helmet greatly increased his attributes . </p>

<p>The boost of the helmet was temporarily shown in parenthesis .  Strength, constitution and even physical damage reduction had been greatly increased .  Jinwoo was immensely satisfied . Confirming the effects with his eyes made his heart race . </p>
<p>‘Wait . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo shook his head . </p>
<p>‘The quest is not over . I need to calm myself . ’</p>
<p>There was one more item he had to check .  Still excited, Jinwoo looked over the two remaining items . </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Instant Return Stone</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Two stones .  Jinwoo first looked at the “Instant Return Stone” .  It was a piece of rock slightly bigger than a walnut .  </p>
<p>‘I know what a Runestone is, but…’</p>
<p>What was an “Instant” Return Stone? His curiosity was quickly answered .  The stone’s information came up in front of him . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>  . </p>

<p><strong>Class Advancement Quest Item</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Break to immediately return to the outside of the Dungeon . </strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>This item will disappear once the quest is complete . </strong>.   </p>
<p>You may not keep this item in your inventory . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The way to use it was the same as a Runestone .  Instead of a skill, breaking it would take him to the outside . </p>
<p>‘Wait, so the class advancement quest isn’t over?’</p>
<p>According to the item’s description, if the quest was over, it should’ve been destroyed .  That meant . </p>
<p>A chill ran down Jinwoo’s spine .  It was a strange feeling . He received a way to exit the Dungeon in case of an emergency, so why did he feel so uneasy? If this was something that could be used in a real Dungeon, the stone’s value would be incalculable .  The little rock was equivalent to a lifesaving device, who would be stingy with their money on something like that? Of course, Jinwoo felt the same way . This should’ve decreased the danger in the quest greatly . </p>
<p>‘If I wanted to, I can leave any time I want…’</p>
<p>Despite all this, he could not shake the dread that he was feeling .  As if it was waiting, the System warned him with its tone . </p>
<p>ring . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The player has obtained the Instant Return Stone . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Class Advancement Quest will now begin . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Ah! So this was the item that started the quest! Jinwoo was shocked .  He felt like he had stepped on a mine that could’ve been avoided . </p>
<p>‘If I knew this, I would’ve rested before picking it up…’</p>
<p>It was too late to regret it now .  No matter how much he combined his experience and intelligence, it was impossible to predict the future with a 100% certainty .  Cold sweat gathered on his brows . He checked his status . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>HP: 4,161 / 10,270</strong>. </p>
<p>MP: 390 / 850</p>
<p>Fatigue: 61</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘The fatigue is a bit high, but it’s still manageable . ’</p>
<p>Thanks to the increase in constitution from the helmet, both his current and maximum health went up proportionately .  Thank goodness for that . Jinwoo tried to cheer himself up a little . </p>
<p>‘This is still doable . For now . ’</p>
<p>Ultimately, his life wouldn’t be in danger .  He was holding the Instant Return Stone in his hand .  But no matter how he thought about it, the stone represented giving-up on the quest .  If not, it would not have been given to him as the starting signal . </p>
<p>‘And if I give-up on the quest…’</p>
<p>It’d be no different than giving up on obtaining a class .  The sweat that gathered now fell in streaks down his face . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>The System’s next message appeared . </p>
<p>ring . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>In 10 seconds, dimensional gates will start opening at random . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Dimensional gates?’ [1]</p>
<p>Before he could figure out what those words meant, the System produced a huge screen with numbers high in the air . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>00:00:10</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Well, that was easy enough to understand .  It was probably the countdown it spoke of earlier .  The messages continued . </p>

<p>The countdown continued . </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Endure? Endure what?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo uttered loudly in frustration .  His hand was already holding Casaka’s Poisoned Fang, summoned from the inventory .  The Runestone was placed in the inventory, and the Instant Return Stone that he could not store was placed in his back pocket .  </p>
<p>While his heart felt like it was about to explode, he had finished his combat preparations .  </p>
<p>This was Sung Jinwoo . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Class Advancement Quest will begin soon . </strong>. </p>

<p> . 4, 3, 2 . </p>
<p>Jinwoo stared at the numbers counting down, then surveilled his surroundings .  His gaze quickly fell here and there . Something was about to start . The air in the room started to twist and become distorted . </p>

<p>What?</p>
<p>It was the first time the System displayed a semblance of emotion, but there was no time to be surprised .  The moment the timer hit 0, gates[2] started appearing in various places around the room . </p>
<p>woong-</p>
<p>woong-</p>
<p>It wasn’t just one or two .  There were 6 close to him, behind them were many more appearing .  At the same time, the timer started to count forward . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>00:00:02</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The countdown had started again .  This time, it would time his trial here .  The advancement points would depend on his record .  The System wasn’t fully clear, but Jinwoo understood as much . </p>
<p>‘I’ll become stronger the more I endure . ’</p>
<p>More accurately, he would obtain a more powerful class .  He could not waste an opportunity like this . There was breathing room in his HP and MP . </p>
<p>‘Let’s endure as much as I can . ’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>00:00:03</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The exact moment the timer reached 3 seconds, the nearest gates started spawning a multitude of knights without weapons . </p>
<p>clack-clack-clack-clack</p>
<p>The ground shook as the armored knights got into formation .  They looked like a silver tidal wave frozen in time, waiting to crash down upon him .  Even in face of the oppressive force, a smile appeared on Jinwoo’s face . </p>
<p>‘If it’s just this much, I can take them on . ’</p>
<p>In a way, he was thankful that it was just this level of enemies .  If something like Ygritte came out of those gates, he couldn’t imagine lasting more than seconds . </p>
<p>‘Stealth!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo used what little mana he had left to go into ‘Stealth’ . </p>
<p>‘It’s a lot, but I’ll use it to first check out the situation . ’</p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>The Hunter’s form disappeared from sight .  As expected, the knights that were running toward him all slowed down and stopped .  Unfortunately, something happened that Jinwoo did not expect,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>A mage has used ‘Eye of Detection’ . [3]</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The System beeped with warning .  Jinwoo turned his head towards the sound . </p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>A mage that had appeared from one of the gates was casting a spell .  Jinwoo saw an eye-shaped mark above its head . The mark sparkled, and Jinwoo’s ‘Stealth’ was released . </p>
<p>‘Shit!’</p>
<p>His plans went kaput from the start . </p>
<p>turn . </p>
<p>turn . </p>
<p>The knights that stood motionless after he disappeared turned their heads in unison towards Jinwoo .  It was a scene straight out of a horror movie . The silver tidal wave fell upon the man . He clenched his teeth and prepared himself . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>His punch blew off a knight’s head .  His victim fell on the spot . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated the Knight . </strong>. </p>

<p>A light gathered in Jinwoo’s eyes . </p>
<p>‘Bloodlust!’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Bloodlust has been activated . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He was able to slow many of the monsters with the fear’s effects, but his mana had fallen all the way to 90 .  The ‘Bloodlust’ mana cost was 100 . He would not be able to use it again . </p>
<p>‘But I bought myself a minute with this . ’</p>
<p>In the single minute that the monsters’ attributes were lowered, Jinwoo merciless destroyed as many enemies as he could . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Kaboom!</p>
<p>In face of the Hunter’s terrifying might, the knights crumpled left and right . </p>
<p>Bang! Boom! Crack!</p>
<p>However, the speed at which new knights spawned outpaced Jinwoo’s ability to destroy them . </p>
<p>clack-clack-clack-clack</p>
<p>In the middle of frantic melee, Jinwoo checked the time . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>00:03:19</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>3 minutes and 19 seconds .  Jinwoo wondered how many points that translated to .  What would he receive if he left now? The situation was becoming more and more unbearable by the second .  The onslaught of the knights continued from the gates . He had destroyed many of them, but their numbers remained uncountable . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaah-!”</p>
<p>Eventually, Jinwoo was buried in the mass of the knights . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>‘Unyielding Spirit’ has been activated . </strong>. </p>

<p>5 minutes and 8 seconds .  He had endured as long as he could . </p>
<p>‘ . Let’s leave . ’</p>
<p>At the bottom of the suffocating dogpile of the knights, Jinwoo reached into his back pocket with effort . </p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>drop</p>
<p>The Instant Return Stone slipped from his hands . </p>
<p>roll roll roll</p>
<p>The round stone was kicked by a knight’s heel and rolled far away . </p>
<p>“NO!!!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo futilely stretched his hand towards his lifeline but could not get through the knights .  More knights piled on top of him . It was becoming hard to breathe . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>‘Unyielding Spirit’ has been activated . </strong>. </p>

<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>‘Unyielding Spirit’ has been activated . </strong>. </p>

<p>He felt his consciousness fade . </p>
<p>clang! clang clang!</p>
<p>In the chaos of the knights clashing on top of him, Jinwoo heard a laughter coming from somewhere . </p>
<p>- “Didn’t you bring all this down on yourself?”</p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>- “Why go down such a dangerous path over a safe one? If an E-rank Hunter became a B-rank, or even a C-rank, wouldn’t it have been an incredible stroke of luck?”</p>
<p>‘ . ”</p>
<p>- “I guess this is all you’re worth . ”</p>
<p>‘ . Shut up . ’</p>
<p>- “You are the reason you will die here . ”</p>
<p>Shut! Up!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>The knights that had piled up on Jinwoo were all blasted back .  Even on the edge of death, the Hunter’s eyes were still alive . They were filled with the spirit of determination . </p>
<p>‘I’m not going to let it end like this . ’</p>
<p>Just how do you think he obtained this opportunity?</p>
<p>No .  It would not end here . </p>
<p>He knew what it was like to be at the absolute bottom of the world, and that’s why he desired to stand at the absolute peak .  More than anyone else, he knew the weak one’s pain . He had done cowardly things to survive and was met with ridicule in doing so . </p>
<p>“How much of a help could an E-ranker be?”</p>
<p>“Even if it’s the Association, couldn’t they have sent someone more helpful? This guy’s just…”</p>
<p>“Is that punk just surviving by hiding behind his teammates?”</p>
<p>The ladder to the peak that he had only dreamt about had finally appeared before him .  Did they expect him to just stare and do nothing? There was no way . </p>
<p>‘ . I remember . ’</p>
<p>That voice in his head .  It was “their” voice . The voices that whispered behind his back . </p>
<p>Sure, go ahead .  Laugh . </p>
<p>I will struggle until the end . </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if my health is 10 or 1 .  I will fight to the bitter end . Until my bones are dust and my muscles are torn . </p>
<p>“UWAAAH-!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo threw his body at the knights . </p>
<p>Smash!</p>
<p>His fist flew forward .  A knight’s breastplate caved in and its wearer was sent flying .  Like a bowling ball, the flying body knocked down other knights in its path .  Unrelenting, the knights charged at him once more . Jinwoo struggled even harder . </p>
<p>Bang! Smash! Boom!</p>
<p>Fists . Elbows . Knees . Feet . </p>
<p>Jinwoo threw every part of his body at his enemies .  Each time he attacked, a knight crumpled like a paper doll . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your fatigue is over 70 . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your movements will be restricted . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As the warning said, his body began to slow down .  But the light in Jinwoo’s eyes did not fade . Eventually, the knights continued even after one or two hits .  Still, if they won’t go down in one hit, he would just strike them twice . If they won’t go down in two hits, he would strike them three times .  Four times . Five times . </p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong> . 8, 7, 6, 5</strong>. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, some sort of a countdown was happening .  Jinwoo was focused on the battle at hand and had not noticed it before . </p>
<p>‘What? Is the quest ending?’</p>
<p>His brief moment of hope was quickly dashed . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>00:06:27</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The quest timer was still climbing .  Whatever was happening in front of him was unrelated to the timer . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>4, 3, 2</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Are you counting down to my death?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo thought to the System .  He remembered the first time it spoke to him .  How it threatened to stop his heart in 0 . 02 seconds if he did not accept becoming a player . </p>
<p>Good . </p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes opened wide . </p>
<p>‘I’ll use you until the very last second . ’</p>
<p>Bang! Kaboom!</p>
<p>Two more knights were crushed .  However, compared to his fighting spirit, Jinwoo’s body was unrecognizable .  The strength behind his shoulders were gone . The slowed fists could no longer block the knights’ attacks . </p>
<p>One from the front, one from the back . </p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Crushed between the two charging knights, Jinwoo let out a painful groan . </p>
<p>“Kuk!”</p>
<p>Not missing the opening, the knights closed in on Jinwoo once more .  Imprisoned by the multitude, he could not lift a finger . </p>
<p>clack-clack-clack-clack</p>
<p>Even still, more and more knights piled towards the Hunter .  The silver tide turned in to a silver mountain . Jinwoo breathed what he imagined to be his last breaths . </p>
<p>“Hah . Hah…!”</p>
<p>So this was the end . </p>
<p>Somehow, Jinwoo found a small opening and stretched his hand to the sky .  It was a meaningless gesture in the moment . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>HP: 93 / 10,270</strong>. </p>

<p>The situation was hopeless . </p>
<p>But Jinwoo did not give up . </p>
<p>‘No, not yet… just… a little more…’</p>
<p>The hand that was held to the sky clenched into a fist .  </p>
<p>In that moment, the unknown countdown finished . </p>
