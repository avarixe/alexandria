<h3>Chapter 193: Chapter 193</h3> <p>Adam White urgently confirmed the signs of life on Thomas Andre </p>
<p>Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump… </p>
<p>He pressed his ear to the chest of the unmoving man and heard the faint beating of the heart . He even brought his hand near Thomas Andre’s nose and felt for his breathing, too . Fortunately enough, he was still alive </p>
<p>However, he was barely hanging on . He might be alive but, he didn’t resemble a living man right now . That’s how bad his condition was </p>
<p>‘To think, he’s capable of reducing the one and only Thomas Andre to this state… . ’. </p>
<p>Just how many Hunters in the world would be capable of doing this? No, was there anyone even remotely capable of doing that, to begin with?. </p>
<p>If this news got out, then the entire world would be turned on its head almost instantly . Adam White even felt an emotion similar to awe at Jin-Woo’s strength that had easily exceeded the Hunter Bureau’s expectations </p>
<p>Unfortunately, now wasn’t the time to stand around in awe </p>
<p>“Hurry!”. </p>
<p>Adam White gestured towards the Hunter Bureau’s Healers </p>
<p>One of the top-rated Healers quickly ran over and settled down next to the patient on the ground . After confirming Thomas Andre’s condition before the healing could properly commence, the Healer clicked his tongue and spoke up </p>
<p>“Every bone in his body is broken . Haemorrhaging is quite serious, as well . I alone won’t be able to heal him . It’ll be better for everyone to participate at once . ”. </p>
<p>Following the Healer’s suggestion, more of his colleagues were added to the process of healing Thomas Andre </p>
<p>But then, could anyone fill up a lake with water from a tap? Because of how vast Thomas Andre’s overall health reserve was, one needed to expend a great deal of effort in order to heal him </p>
<p>As the Healers sweated profusely and focused on healing the American Hunter, Adam White stood back up from the ground to survey the landscape . He saw the Hunters from the Bureau keeping themselves busy by pulling out the injured from the abandoned factory </p>
<p>“Euh, euh… . ”. </p>
<p>“My leg, my leg!!”. </p>
<p>The state of the Scavenger’s elite Hunters were wretched, to say the least . It was unknown how they ended up in such a miserable state, but it was not that hard to guess just who was responsible for them looking like that </p>
<p>One man versus one Guild </p>
<p>Just one Hunter managed to utterly destroy one of the top Guilds in the entire world </p>
<p>‘Seriously…’. </p>
<p>Adam White was utterly flabbergasted by the incredibleness of Hunter Seong Jin-Woo, and his abilities that played a key role in this display of incredibleness </p>
<p>‘…Uh?’. </p>
<p>Now that he took another look, he couldn’t see Hunter Seong Jin-Woo anywhere . Adam White searched around to locate the Korean Hunter, but before he could locate his query, a rather familiar ‘song’ entered his ears, instead </p>
<p>It was the ringtone coming from his phone </p>
<p>“This is White . ”. </p>
<p>– “Agent White, we discovered Yu Jin-Ho Hunter-nim’s current whereabouts . ”. </p>
<p>The call came from the Hunter Bureau . Out of all the stories he heard today, this had to be the best one so far . Adam White’s gloomy-looking expression brightened up once more </p>
<p>“Really? Where is he now?”. </p>
<p>The caller informed him that the grievously-injured Hunter Yu Jin-Ho was discovered in front of a major hospital nearby, and his life was no longer in danger after having received a timely emergency medical treatment </p>
<p>“I’ll head there right away as soon as the matters this side are sorted out . ”. </p>
<p>– “Understood . ”. </p>
<p>Adam White ended the call and sighed in relief </p>
<p>“Whew…”. </p>
<p>He had no idea how he’d go about dealing with Hunter Seong Jin-Woo’s wrath if something really bad happened to Yu Jin-Ho . Just thinking about it made him dizzy </p>
<p>Spilt milk couldn’t be saved, anyway . Should he say that the glass holding the milk not breaking was a silver lining among the sea of storm clouds?. </p>
<p>A small load was taken off his mind and soon, he got to hear yet another piece of good news </p>
<p>“We’re finished . ”. </p>
<p>The Healers tasked with mending Thomas Andre stood up from the ground . Adam White asked them for a status update </p>
<p>“How is he? Is he alright?”. </p>
<p>“For now . ”. </p>
<p>“For now…? What does that mean?”. </p>
<p>“His injured body has been healed, but he did suffer many grievous wounds and it will take some time before he regains consciousness . ”. </p>
<p>“Oh . ”. </p>
<p>Magic from the Healers might be able to restore one’s physical wounds, but they were unable to lighten one’s psychological trauma </p>
<p>And since Thomas Andre no doubt suffered a huge mental setback this time ’round, his hospital room would have to be closely monitored . Adam White could only look on at the unconscious face of the Special Authority-rank Hunter with a look of pity . Still, the Healer did find words that provided a bit of comfort and delivered them </p>
<p>“Even then, it was because it was Special Authority-rank Hunter Thomas Andre that he got to survive this long . If it was any other Hunter being on the receiving end of this much punishment, that person would have died ten times over by now . ”. </p>
<p>“What a reli… . ”. </p>
<p>Adam White nodded and was about to say something suitable as a reply, but then, his words came to a stop </p>
<p>Only because it was the Special Authority-rank Hunter Thomas Andre, he could survive this event?. </p>
<p>If so, what about Hunter Hwang Dong-Su who must’ve been subjected to the one-sided outpouring of Seong Jin-Woo’s rage?. </p>
<p>Was that man around here, as well?. </p>
<p>Carrying a hardened expression, Adam White quickly made his way into the abandoned factory as more injured were carted out . Once inside, he took a look around and heard someone call out to him </p>
<p>“Agent White! Over here!”. </p>
<p>That urgent voice quickened Adam White’s thought process . He tried to calm his pounding heart and ran towards where that call came from </p>
<p>One of the Bureau’s Hunters with a serious expression on his face was standing in front of a person lying on the floor . Adam White recognised who it was and whispered out the name of the man like a groan </p>
<p>“Hwang Dong-Su… . ”. </p>
<p>That prompted the Hunter next to him to speak his findings </p>
<p>“This man is not breathing, sir . His heart is not beating anymore . ”. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>“I hope you ain’t gonna waste my time by telling me some bullsh*t story about you kidding around or making a mistake here . ”. </p>
<p>It was already getting pretty late . The editor of a certain publication had come out to meet a freelance reporter after the latter gave him a call . Understandably, the editor’s glare was icy </p>
<p>Just who was he?. </p>
<p>He was none other than the editor of the newspaper boasting the highest circulation figures in the eastern United States </p>
<p>Originally, someone like a freelancer wouldn’t be able to summon him out for an impromptu meeting like this . But then, he had no choice but to make this trip after hearing the contents of the phone call </p>
<p>The editor told himself that, if this freelancer was going to waste his time with a fairy tale, then he’d make d*mn sure that this guy ended up in jail with a fake crime he came up with . That was his thought process as he hurriedly put back on the clothes he wore during the day at work for this meeting in the dark </p>
<p>The reporter quickly waved his hands around after being subjected to the editor’s suspicious glare </p>
<p>“It’s d-definitely nothing like that . This thing is 100% real . I thought you only liked stories that are real?”. </p>
<p>“Hmph… . ”. </p>
<p>“So, how much are you willing to offer?”. </p>
<p>“Let me see the photos first . ”. </p>
<p>The reporter looked around his vicinity as if he was scared of something and began pulling out one photograph after another from his bag . The editor took them with an expressionless face and began flipping through them, but then, his hands came to an abrupt halt </p>
<p>And an almighty earthquake erupted in his eyes next </p>
<p>‘H-how can this be?!’. </p>
<p>The editor’s astonished gaze naturally shifted over to the reporter’s face next </p>
<p>His expression clearly was asking, ‘Where did you get these pictures?’ and that made the reporter feel like he was on the top of the world . He quickly shrugged his shoulders as his reply </p>
<p>The editor continued to flip through the pictures with trembling hands </p>
<p>They were exactly as the reporter had described over the phone </p>
<p>‘Thomas Andre passes out after getting beaten to a pulp a day before the International Guild Conference?’. </p>
<p>Not only that – the face of the man leisurely turning around to leave after defeating the American was captured within these pictures </p>
<p>Wasn’t that Hunter Seong Jin-Woo??. </p>
<p>This was a huge scoop </p>
<p>No, hang on – that word ‘scoop’ wasn’t adequate enough to fully describe this incredible jackpot . The editor’s breathing became really rough and heavy now </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the reporter peered at the picture the editor was looking at and added some of his explanation </p>
<p>“That’s the man who beat up Thomas Andre . If you can investigate and uncover that guy’s identity in an expose, I think you’re going to create one hell of a firestorm, Mister Editor . ”. </p>
<p>What a moron this guy was!. </p>
<p>Allegedly, Westerners had a problem telling Asian faces apart . Maybe because of that, the reporter had failed to recognise Seong Jin-Woo’s face </p>
<p>In times like these, the editor felt rather thankful for being an Asian American . And at the same time, he began cooking up the headlines that would dominate the front page of tomorrow’s paper </p>
<p>[The man who brought down the Dragon, bitten &amp; brought back to earth by an Asian dragon . ]. </p>
<p>[The Hunter of Giants, Seong Jin-Woo – now even hunting down the Goliath?]. </p>
<p>[The stronghold of a Special Authority-rank Hunter, collapsing under the new rising star of South Korea?]. </p>
<p>Didn’t matter what headlines he decided to use, this news would attract the attention of the entire world . Most importantly, his paper would have the exclusive </p>
<p>There were dozens of real photographic proof prepared as well, so how could there not be a huge commotion rising up in the world come tomorrow?. </p>
<p>The actual worth of these pictures could not be estimated at all . The editor felt his heart quiver </p>
<p>Having discovered the trembling light within the editor’s eyes, the reporter quickly snatched the pictures back </p>
<p>The editor could only lick his lips in wistfulness </p>
<p>“Now that you have confirmed the veracity of these pictures, let’s talk about my price . How much are you willing to pay me?”. </p>
<p>“This… . Well, it’s a bit difficult for me to come out with a price for these pictures . ”. </p>
<p>The editor hesitated greatly before asking the reporter as he carefully studied the other party </p>
<p>“Why don’t you quote me a price you think is fair? So, how much do you want for them?”. </p>
<p>The reporter pondered his options for a while, before unfurling all five of his fingers on his hand . The editor nodded his head </p>
<p>“Fifty grand? Good . We’ll go with that . ”. </p>
<p>“No . ”. </p>
<p>The reporter immediately corrected the editor on the price </p>
<p>“It’s five million dollars . ”. </p>
<p>“F-five million?!”. </p>
<p>Five million U . S . Dollars is a huge amount of money equalling as much as 6,000,000,000 Korean Won </p>
<p>Quite obviously, the expression on the editor’s face hardened instantly </p>
<p>“If you think the price isn’t right, then I’ll just go somewhere else . ”. </p>
<p>The reporter shoved the pictures back inside the bag and tried to turn around . However, the editor hurriedly stopped him </p>
<p>“No, hold on!”. </p>
<p>Images of a celebrity couple’s baby would sell for millions of dollars nowadays, so was there a reason not to spend five million on a scoop of this magnitude?. </p>
<p>Once this news gets out, all the TV stations and other newspapers would be talking about this story non-stop for the next few days . He simply couldn’t let this opportunity slip through his fingers!. </p>
<p>Having arrived at his decision with some difficulty, the editor opened his mouth </p>
<p>“Fine, you got a deal . However, I want not just the pictures but the originals, too . And you’ll have to swear never to leak this out to anyone else . How about it?”. </p>
<p>With that, the deal was made </p>
<p>The reporter had been working as a freelancer and had to wallow at the bottom of society all this time . He thought about being able to see his parents again for the first time since leaving his hometown . His voice trembled slightly as he made his reply </p>
<p>“… . Let’s do it . ”. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The hospital room where Yu Jin-Ho was currently admitted to </p>
<p>He had made it out from death’s doorstep, but he still hadn’t regained his consciousness </p>
<p>Yu Jin-Ho was still breathing out heavily in pain . The pain-suppressing morphine didn’t seem to be all that effective for him </p>
<p>A little bit of time later, after the doctor doing the rounds confirmed Yu Jin-Ho’s current status and left… </p>
<p>… . A humanoid shape rose up from the blob of shadow sneaking into the hospital room </p>
<p>Shururuk… </p>
<p>It was Beru, who swapped locations with Jin-Woo via ‘Shadow Exchange’ </p>
<p>He reached out to heal Yu Jin-Ho, as ordered by his liege . From the tip of his hands, gentle blue light slowly spread out in this darkened room </p>
<p>Yu Jin-Ho’s expression, scrunched up from pain and discomfort, softened in no time at all </p>
<p>Beru already possessed powers incomparable to regular rank S Hunters, so it was quite obvious that his healing magic would be unmatched, as well . The former ant king diligently healed his target’s wounds so he could also mend Yu Jin-Ho’s psychological trauma at the same time </p>
<p>Wuuonng… </p>
<p>Yu Jin-Ho stopped tossing around in the bed after sensing the warmth wrap up his entire body, and eventually, creaked open his heavy eyelids </p>
<p>“Uh… . ?”. </p>
<p>The first thing he saw was a giant ant head right in front of his face . On top of that, that giant ant head placed a finger to its mouth and went “Shh . ” as if to tell him to keep quiet </p>
<p>“… . Oh, so I’m still dreaming . ”. </p>
<p>Yu Jin-Ho closed his eyes shut and went back to sleep with a happy expression etched on his face </p>
<p>“… ”. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Beru wordlessly concentrated on healing the kid </p>
<p>The night wore on </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Seoul, the capital city of South Korea </p>
<p>There was a 14-hour difference between here and the eastern United States . It may have been in the middle of the night over there, but it was in the morning in Korea </p>
<p>The current location was a deserted children’s playground </p>
<p>A black knight with his head pressed tightly on the ground next to a swing set asked </p>
<p>“Oh, my king . How long should I stay in this position?”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo, currently sitting quietly on the swing and waiting for Beru’s signal, replied disinterestedly </p>
<p>“I guess… . Until Beru reports back to me that he’s done with Jin-Ho’s treatment?”. </p>
<p>“… . ”. </p>
<p>Perhaps the knight recognised his faults in this matter because he kept his mouth shut and maintained the ‘Wonsan bombing raid’ posture . (TL note at the end). </p>
<p>Jin-Woo wordlessly stared at the knight before his gaze abruptly landed on his hands </p>
<p>The back of his hands were all messed up . There were several bruises and he could spot traces of blood as well </p>
<p>That Thomas Andre, he was truly one nonsensically sturdy dude . Just from Jin-Woo beating the living crap out of him, his hands ended up getting bruised to this degree </p>
<p>Of course, such wounds would be gone without a trace after a good night’s rest all thanks to the passive buff, ‘Good Health and Long Life’, but still </p>
<p>‘… . I’m sleepy . ’. </p>
<p>He felt a bit of fatigue rush in . A chaotic day was finally drawing to a rather subdued close </p>
<p>The knight, staying quiet for a while, suddenly addressed Jin-Woo again </p>
<p>“Oh, my king… . ”. </p>
<p>“What is it?”. </p>
<p>“Please, bestow unto me a new name, my king . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo shifted his gaze over to his brand-new Shadow Soldier </p>
<p>[?? Lv . 1]. </p>
<p>Knight Commander grade. </p>
<p>‘Right, I guess you also need a name, don’t you?’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo pondered this dilemma for a little bit before forming a wry smile as he spoke </p>
<p>“Since you died because of your greed, how about I call you ‘Greed’?”. </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 193 &gt; Fin </p>
