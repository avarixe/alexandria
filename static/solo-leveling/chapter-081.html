<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 81</p>
<p>knock knock </p>
<p>“Sir, I have the file you requested . ”</p>
<p>“Come in . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol entered the association president’s office .  Having waited for the chief, Go Gunhee greeted him with a bright expression .  Taking the documents from Woo Jincheol, the elderly association president looked at the picture on top . </p>
<p>It was Jinwoo . </p>
<p>The picture was taken in the past when the young man first received his license .  While the difference in the man was great between the past and the present, it was still easily recognizable as Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Hmm . ”</p>
<p>Reading down the list of Jinwoo’s activity records, Go Gunhee’s eyes became somber . </p>
<p>‘Not only an E-ranker, but the weakest of them . He worked as a Hunter for four years like that?’</p>
<p>The man’s actions were no different than suicide .  No matter how easy the Association’s Raids were compared to the Guild’s, it was still at a level that would stifle an E-ranker .  Appropriately, Jinwoo had spent a long time in hospitals during his career as a Hunter . </p>
<p>“He endured well with all these injuries . ”</p>
<p>“They said he could not leave the Association because of his mother’s medical bills . ”</p>
<p>“ . What a rare youth in today’s world . ”</p>
<p>A light filled Go Gunhee’s eyes . </p>
<p>‘In lieu of his missing father, he took care of his little sister and ill mother on his own…’</p>
<p>The association president had decided to look over Jinwoo’s files out of interest when he learned that the E-rank Hunter had Reawakened but did not expect to find something like this .  More and more he learned about him, Go Gunhee felt that he was a good man . </p>
<p>‘What a shame that I have to hand him over to the Guilds . ’</p>
<p>After reading Jinwoo’s file, the fact that he had failed to persuade the young man into joining the Association fet more and more disappointing . </p>
<p>Go Gunhee clicked his tongue and turned the page, but he had reached the end of the file .  With a satisfied expression, the elder closed the file . </p>
<p>“Good work . ”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir . ”</p>
<p>Woo Jincheol took the documents and was about to leave, but then turned around and spoke with difficulty,</p>
<p>“Er… association president . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Go Gunhee raised his head .  Woo Jincheol had an awkward look on his face . </p>
<p>‘He normally looks like he wouldn’t bleed if you cut him . To think that Chief Woo could make a face like that…’</p>
<p>Was there something difficult he wanted to say? Go Gunhee became curious,</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The chief continued after a moment of hesitation,</p>
<p>“There’s something I have to report… Just a moment ago, we’ve received a word that Hunter Sung Jinwoo has entered a Raid . ”</p>
<p>“Already? Whose Raid is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s a Raid from Hunters Guild . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Hunters Guild you say . ”</p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo ended up choosing Hunters Guild .  And only after one day . Go Gunhee’s face became dark . </p>
<p>‘After all that talk, was he swayed by the amount Hunters Guild offered him?’</p>
<p>If that was the case, Go Gunhee would truly be disappointed .  He had been deeply moved after meeting such a great man after a long time .  However, when he recalled the young Hunter’s attitude yesterday, combined with the file he had just gone over, Jinwoo did not seem like a man to change his mind that easily .  No, there must be another reason . </p>
<p>Like,</p>
<p>“If you wanted to fight with strong magic beasts, Hunters Guild certainly would be the best place to do so . ”</p>
<p>Go Gunhee decided to tell himself that that was the reason .  However, Woo Jincheol’s next words kicked that reason away,</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s it, association president . ”</p>
<p>“Was there more information?”</p>
<p>“According to our records… Hunter Sung Jinwoo did not enter the raiding party . Instead… he went into the mining team . ”</p>
<p>Go Gunhee shot up from his seat . </p>
<p>“What? An S-rank Hunter volunteered as a miner?”</p>
<p>The elder could not believe it .  In fact, Woo Jincheol agreed . The HSD chief had repeatedly checked and confirmed the information, but the reports remained the same . </p>
<p>‘This is why I was hesitant to report it…’</p>
<p>Just what was Sung Jinwoo thinking? With sweat gathering at his brows, Woo Jincheol replied,</p>
<p>“That is what was reported, sir . ”</p>
<p>Go Gunhee collapsed onto his chair and laughed . </p>
<p>“What an amusing young man . ”</p>
<p>Wearing the hard hat and work clothes he had received, Jinwoo followed behind Team Leader Bae Yoonsuk .  Near the Gate, many Hunters wearing hard hats were gathered . Roughly 20 of them? All their gazes turned to Team Leader Bae .  The mustache ahjussi introduced Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“This is Sung-ssi . He’ll be joining us today . ”</p>
<p>“Hello, everyone . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo lightly bowed his head then read the Hunters’ moods . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>They were all rather being cold .  Jinwoo understood why . </p>
<p>‘After all,’</p>
<p>He was just a temp that might not even show up tomorrow, while they were Hunters officially contracted with the Guild as members of the mining team .  From their point of view, there was no reason for them to be friendly with him . </p>
<p>“My god, you people are… Come on, he’s still a teammate that’ll be working with you all . ”</p>
<p>Team Leader Bae smiled awkwardly and pointed at an intimidating-looking Hunter . </p>
<p>“Sung-ssi, you can just stick to Mok-ssi over there . If there’s anything you don’t know, you can learn from him . He’s a little quiet, but he’s the most veteran miner here . ”</p>
<p>“ . I understand . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo walked over and stood silently next to the man named Mok-ssi .  Mok-ssi met Jinwoo’s eyes and spoke in a barely audible voice,</p>
<p>“Mok Jinsoo . ”</p>
<p>“I’m Sung Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>That was it for their greeting .  Mok Jinsoo immediately turned back to the team leader . </p>
<p>‘Everyone sure is friendly . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo also turned his gaze .  Some distance away, the team leader and a Guild employee that looked like an ordinary man were sharing what looked like a serious talk .  Focusing just a little, Jinwoo was able to eavesdrop on their conversation . </p>
<p>“ . Is the attack team still in there? They told us that they were done a while ago, why is it taking so long?”</p>
<p>“They’re really almost done . This is all for the safety of you and your team members, so please just wait a little longer until all the magic beasts are down . ”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that three times already . ”</p>
<p>“Team leader, you know how dangerous it could be if they half-ass the clean-up . What if a hidden magic beast leaped out at your team?”</p>
<p>As the man young enough to be his son smiled with his eyes and explained, Team Leader Bae could not stay angry; he shook his head and smiled . </p>
<p>“I got it, I got it . ”</p>
<p>“Oh? Did you calm down a bit?”</p>
<p>“I said I got it . Go do your job . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . Once they come out, I’ll make sure to run here with all my might and let you know . Oh yeah, you know we’re all going for happy-hour after, right?”</p>
<p>“I know, so go do your damn job, ya punk . ”</p>
<p>Thankfully, it looked like the conversation ended in a friendly mood .  The employee had handled the situation with finesse . </p>
<p>‘You’d think that everyone working in large Guilds would be arrogant hot-heads…’</p>
<p>However, the Guild employees doing clerical work were ordinary men, while the Hunters doing the physical labor were Awakened Beings .  There were a lot of jobs that the Awakened Beings had to do but a limited number of Awakened Beings . You couldn’t just take one out and replace them with another like pieces of a machine .  And that’s why the staff employees watched their words and attitudes around the Hunters . While the public may view the white-collar employees of large Guilds with envy, the employees had their share of frustrations and hard work . </p>
<p>‘ . Hmm?’</p>
<p>As he eased up on focusing on the distant conversation, Jinwoo heard whispers coming from behind him . </p>
<p>“Did you hear? The temp today is an E-ranker . ”</p>
<p>‘This again?’</p>
<p>Like in the past, Jinwoo sometimes hated his keen hearing . </p>
<p>‘Not like I can just go around with my ears covered…’</p>
<p>While he chuckled defeatedly, his teammates’ quiet conversations continued,</p>
<p>“What? E-rank?”</p>
<p>“They picked an E-ranker?”</p>
<p>“Yeah . ”</p>
<p>He felt the fiery gazes falling on the back of his head . </p>
<p>“I mean, why the hell did the team leader pick an E-ranker?”</p>
<p>“Would an E-ranker even be of any use?”</p>
<p>“I know, right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if we’ll be able to finish on time today . ”</p>
<p>Worried voices came from here and there .  While they were being considerate of his feelings and keeping their voices down, their efforts meant nothing before Jinwoo’s heightened senses .  Jinwoo swallowed a laughter . </p>
<p>‘Looks like there was another reason why they were so cold . ’</p>
<p>As expected, E-rankers were looked down on everywhere .  Because he was so used to it, he didn’t feel annoyed . </p>
<p>‘Besides, I’ll be putting that title behind me soon . ’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it got noisy around the Gate . </p>
<p>“The attack team must be out . ”</p>
<p>“Looks like they’re finally done . ”</p>
<p>Tired of waiting, the mining team’s Hunters cheered up a bit .  Watching the scene, Team Leader Bae gestured to his team . </p>
<p>“Alright, let’s get moving . ”</p>
<p>The mining team Hunters each gathered their gear and started walking, Jinwoo included . </p>
<p>“Thank you for your hard work . ”</p>
<p>“Thank you . ”</p>
<p>“Everyone, good job today!”</p>
<p>In front of the Gate, Hunters Guild’s employees were happily greeting the exiting raiding party .  Jinwoo realized “attack team” was referring to “raiding party” around here . [1]</p>
<p>‘These guys are… the nation’s strongest raiding party . ’</p>
<p>Looking at the high-rank, no, the highest-ranking Hunters, Jinwoo’s eyes sharpened .  He recognized a face among them . </p>
<p>‘ . Choi Jongin . ’</p>
<p>Hunters Guild’s Guildmaster and a Mage-class S-rank Hunter . </p>
<p>Jinwoo felt like it would get annoying if Choi Jongin recognized him, so he pressed his hard hat down .  Fortunately, there were many Hunters around him wearing the same thing, and Jinwoo was able to blend into the background .  As he quietly studied the country’s top raiding party members while hidden amidst the miners,</p>
<p>‘ . These are the main members of Hunters Guild?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo could not hide his shock .  Despite of his expectations, it was difficult for him to find a Hunter with a strong energy .  While Choi Jongin gave off an incredible magic power deserving of his title as the “Strongest Soldier”, the rest were rather disappointing . </p>
<p>‘Are they that weak?’</p>
<p>Of course not .  Jinwoo shook his head .  The members of the main raiding party of the country’s number one Guild were chosen after an incredible amount of scrutiny . </p>
<p>‘The Guildmaster himself participated in the Raid . I doubt the members of his party would be put together that poorly . ’</p>
<p>No, the word “weak” was as far as it could be from these men .  That meant one thing:</p>
<p>‘I have become that strong . ’</p>
<p>The corners of Jinwoo’s mouth rose .  Strength was relative . His efforts in the past few months had not betrayed him .  It took him to a place where even these Hunters that just cleared an A-rank Dungeon felt weak to him .  The relative strength between them and him gave him the assurance that he had become strong . </p>
<p>ba dum ba dum ba dum</p>
<p>It made his heart beat faster . </p>
<p>In that moment… No one had said anything .  No one had told him to do so . </p>
<p>But Jinwoo’s gaze naturally drifted towards the Gate . </p>
<p>A feeling of wonder overtook him . </p>
<p>‘My god…’</p>
<p>A short-haired woman was leisurely walking out of the Gate .  What caught his attention first was her big and clear eyes, adorning her makeup-free face .  Her clear, white skin and perfect face were equally eye-catching . She was a beauty that would invite brazen compliments from 99 out of a 100 men . [2]</p>
<p>However, what turned his gaze to her in the first place was not her beauty, but what he felt inside of her . </p>
<p>The strength that resided in her body . </p>
<p>An enormous amount of magic power was ceaselessly emanating from the expressionless female Hunter . </p>
<p>‘At the very least, it’s on the level of Choi Jongin’</p>
<p>Perhaps higher . </p>
<p>She exuded an incredible aura of pressure . </p>
<p>When he calmed his surprise and succeeded in expelling all earthly desires from his mind, Jinwoo realized who this was . </p>
<p>‘That woman is…’</p>
<p>Korea’s sole female S-ranker, Cha Haein . [3]</p>
<p>Along with Choi Jongin, she was the other axis of Hunters Guild, the highest of rankers . </p>
<p>‘It can’t be anyone else . ’</p>
<p>How many other women in Korea wielded this much power? Compared to her fame, Cha Haein’s face was not known to the public; the female Hunter had distanced herself from appearing in the media .  As such, this was the first time Jinwoo saw her face . </p>
<p>‘Contrary to the rumors, she’s not weird looking at all . Why would she hate the cameras so much?’</p>
<p>Girls in their early 20s often enjoyed being in front of the camera .  Well, mostly just a cellphone . </p>
<p>Perhaps feeling his gaze, Cha Haein turned her head toward Jinwoo’s direction . </p>
<p>‘I shouldn’t need to… use ‘Stealth’, right?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo hid his presence, and the young woman looking over the mining team became confused . </p>
<p>‘What was that? I just felt a strong presence . ’</p>
<p>Was she imagining it? At first, she thought Association President Go Gunhee had arrived in the area .  But the presence had completely disappeared, as if it was never there . </p>
<p>‘The association president is a busy man . There’s no way he would visit us without a notice . ’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cost of her distraction was huge .  She had heightened her senses to look for the strong presence .  Because of that, the foul stench she normally smelled assaulted her nose stronger than usual . </p>
<p>‘Ugh . ’</p>
<p>As she always had done, Cha Haein took out a handkerchief and pinched her nose .  The young woman quickly ran through the other Hunters out of the area . </p>
<p>‘Her senses are pretty good . ’</p>
<p>Watching Cha Haein disappear in the distance, Jinwoo sighed in relief .  And with that, the entire attack team had left the Gate . Having waited for this moment, Team Leader Bae turned to the members of the mining team .  He clapped his hands loudly then spoke with a clear voice,</p>
<p>“Alright, it’s our turn now! Let’s work hard!”</p>
<p>After the collection team entered the Gate, the mining team followed .  Jinwoo stopped in front of the Gate . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>As he stood still and took in the experience of seeing his first A-rank Gate, Bae Yoonsuk approached him,</p>
<p>“Sung-ssi, what’re you doing? We should also go in . ”</p>
<p>“Okay . ”</p>
<p>With a short reply, Jinwoo also stepped through the Gate . </p>
<p>That familiar message appeared, as it always would:</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You have entered a Dungeon . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: attack team (공략대) vs raiding party (공격대) . Both words literally mean the same thing, 공략 and 공격 both mean attack/assault/offense, 대 means team . 공격대 was the commonly used word to refer to a team of hunters that cleared dungeons up until now, and I’ve previously translated that as “raiding party” in the past . </p>
<p>[2]: who da fuck’s the 100th . </p>
<p>[3]: Hello people who read the mtls, car girl has finally arrived .  Or tea girl . Whichever you prefer . </p>
