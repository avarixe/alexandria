<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 27</p>
<p>If it was just the boss, Jinwoo had already shown that he could solo the spider .  But thinking about holding back the horde of insects at the entrance with just the two of them made Yoo Jinho’s breath stop . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Watching Yoo Jinho at a loss for words, Jinwoo nodded understandingly . </p>
<p>‘Still, this is the best method . ’</p>
<p>To kill two birds with one stone . </p>
<p>It was very difficult for an E-ranker like him to get into a private raiding party .  He had realized this after trying to earn money for the month . He could not reserve a Dungeon with his own credentials, and it was impossible for him to form his own raiding party .  But now Yoo Jinho was offering to create the party for him . </p>
<p>This was the perfect opportunity . </p>
<p>“B-but hyungnim! To enter a C-rank Gate, you’d need a minimum party of ten people!”</p>
<p>“If we told them we just needed to fill the headcount and offered them money, people would be lining up . ”</p>
<p>It was the method he had learned from Hwang Dongseok .  The Hunters who did not want to risk their lives but needed money would jump at the opportunity with a hunger in their eyes . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho made an expression of defeat,</p>
<p>“You’re… you’re saying we’ll be taking down all the monsters of the Dungeon on our own?”</p>
<p>Well, it would be just Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Yep . ”</p>
<p>With that method, he would be able to hoard all the experience points to himself .  Additionally, with just Yoo Jinho at his side, he didn’t need to hold back or worry about revealing his true powers . </p>
<p>‘I’ll be able to powerlevel with that . ’</p>
<p>On top of that, after the Raids were complete, he would obtain that valuable building .  Once again, “killing two birds with one stone” . </p>
<p>All that was left to do is convince Yoo Jinho .  As expected, the young man was terrified . </p>
<p>“S-still… wouldn’t it be too dangerous, hyungnim?”</p>
<p>“Tsk, tsk . You understand one thing but not the other . ”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo gestured for Yoo Jinho to come closer, and the young man leaned in . </p>
<p>“If you looked at just the two of us going into the Dungeon from another angle, it means that no one else has to get hurt, right?”</p>
<p>“R-right . ”</p>
<p>“Let’s put aside your first Raid, which you had to join as a tagalong . Imagine how your father will feel if the raid team that you put together goes through nineteen Raids with no one getting hurt . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho’s eyes shot open in understanding .  </p>
<p>If… If they were able to pull that off, convincing his father would become that much easier!</p>
<p>He would be able to show that a mere D-ranker is able to lead a raiding party through 19 Raids without any casualties .  It would be a testament to his ability to become the Guildmaster . This would be the greatest feat that he could bring before his father . </p>
<p>Jinwoo read Yoo Jinho’s expressions and became satisfied . </p>
<p>‘Got him . ’</p>
<p>The one holding all the cards right now was Jinwoo .  Even if Yoo Jinho could not be convinced, he could always ensure his growth through the Association’s Raids or Instant Dungeons; it would just be a matter of time . </p>
<p>In the meantime, Yoo Jinho was deep in thought .  Even if it was a little scary, if everything went according to Jinwoo’s words, the benefit to him would be great .  Thinking back on the unstoppable power that Jinwoo displayed in the last Raid, he felt that it would just be possible . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho made his decision . </p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll agree to those conditions, hyungnim . I’ll gather the team members . ”</p>
<p>“Good . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded .  The two men were in agreement .  Yoo Jinho finally was able to sit-up straight and put on a bright smile . </p>
<p>‘I was able to get hyungnim’s help . ’</p>
<p>The remaining Raids no longer worried him .  He had gained a reliable ally in Jinwoo, and per his condition, gathering the remaining members suddenly became a lot easier .  He no longer needed other capable, low ranking Hunters . Instead, anyone who answered the job boards would do . </p>
<p>‘With this, I’ve taken a step towards becoming a Guildmaster . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was also smiling . </p>
<p>‘I’ll solo all the C-rank Dungeons and quickly raise my levels . ’</p>
<p>The two men left the cafe with satisfied faces . </p>
<p>After bidding farewell to Yoo Jinho, Jinwoo quickly ran home .  He didn’t know when the Association would come calling . It had been 10 days since he was discharged from hospital; it would not be strange for a Gate to appear in their vicinity soon .  On average, the Association had gathered its Hunters two or three times throughout the month for a Raid . The reason he had initially allotted 1 hour to Yoo Jinho was because Jinwoo wanted to be back home as fast as possible . </p>
<p>‘Right now, even missing just one E-rank Dungeon would be regrettable . ’</p>
<p>He wanted to quickly raise his levels through magic beasts .  To think that not having a phone would be this inconvenient . Thankfully, his new phone would be arriving in few days . </p>
<p>Jinwoo opened the door and headed inside . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>The house was quiet .  Since it was a weekday, his little sister was in school .  Confirming that no one else was in the house, Jinwoo opened his daily quest window . </p>
<p>‘Time to grab today’s reward . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo had already finished the daily quest before meeting with Yoo Jinho but did not receive the rewards yet .  He wasn’t about to show off the light of status recovery or the appearance of a gift box out of nowhere in the middle of the street . </p>

<p>“Ye----no . No . ”</p>
<p>He was about to verify the rewards out of habit but quickly stopped himself after noticing something .  His eyes focused on the running part of the quest . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Run 10 kilometers:</strong>. </p>
<p>(Complete) (11/10)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>. <strong>Going over the 10 km requirement by 1 didn’t phase him much at first .  But more he thought about it, it was strange . </strong>. </p>
<p>‘Why would it keep recording after meeting the goal?’</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed .  Was this a coincidence?</p>
<p>He got down on the ground and started performing push-ups in rapid succession, his gaze fixed on the quest screen . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>

<p>‘As I thought…’</p>
<p>Running wasn’t the only category that was recording beyond the goal .  The push-ups were also going above their required amount . </p>
<p>Jinwoo became curious just how high the numbers would go .  His arms flexed, showing their veins . Thanks to his raised attributes, he could barely feel the weight of his body .  It felt as light as feathers . The numbers quickly reached 200 . </p>

<p>The numbers stopped exactly at 200 .  He tried few more times, but they did not go up .  Soon, he had completed the sit-ups and squats to 200 as well . </p>

<p>Exactly 200 .  The tracker was not going up infinitely, nor was it stopping at 100 .  There was something to this . What would be waiting for him when all of the overcaps were met?</p>
<p>‘Time to find out . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo left the house faster than ever .  The 9 km of running was completed in a blink of an eye .  As he finished the run in front of his house, a message arrived . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve completed the ‘Hidden Quest: The Preparation To Become Powerful’</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The reward for completing the quest has arrived . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to verify? (Y/N)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The name of the quest did not change, but the quest type had turned to “hidden” .  His intuitions were correct . Jinwoo gulped . </p>
<p>‘ . Verify . ’</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve received the below rewards . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Three points to every attribute!’</p>
<p>His eyes were wide open .  As expected of a hidden quest, the rewards were amazing .  Adding 3 points to every stat was the same thing as leveling up 3 times .  No, in a way, it was even better . Gaining all these points without raising his levels would make leveling that much easier .  </p>
<p>. <strong>At the same time, he felt a twinge of sadness .  Somewhere deep in him, there was hope that every daily quest going forward could be completed this way, but Jinwoo knew that this was probably a one time deal . </strong>. </p>
<p>And if it was a one time deal, he would have to take great care with Reward 3 . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Reward 3 . Select one:</strong>.   </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>1 . Blessed Random Box (Select)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>2 . Cursed Random Box (Select)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>This was the first time he had to choose between different rewards .  Selecting one would lose the other . </p>
<p>‘So I probably will never be able to see the other . ’</p>
<p>Just going by their names, it was clear which one he had to pick .  But even that could be a trap . </p>
<p>“Accept Reward 3”</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You must choose between the two Random Boxes . </strong>.   </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Blessed Random Box</strong>. </p>
</td> <td> <p><strong>Cursed Random Box</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Will provide what the ‘Player’ wants . </strong>. </p>
</td> <td> <p><strong>Will provide what the ‘Player’ needs . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>   <p><strong>Which one will you choose?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The explanations were simple .  That made the decision even harder .  If there was no explanation, he would’ve chose the blessed one without a thought .  But after reading the explanation, it felt that he would regret the decision no matter which one he picked . </p>
<p>‘Something that I want vs . something that I need…’</p>
<p>At first glance, both sounded good to him . </p>
<p>‘But there is a trap here . ’</p>
<p>Something that he ‘wanted’ would be because it was needed .  But something that he ‘needed’ might not necessarily be something that he wanted .  For example, if he was in a situation where he needed a powerful weapon, a powerful bomb that could blow away everything including him might appear .  </p>
<p>‘That seems fitting of something cursed . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo decided to go with the less risky option .  Not knowing the result yet, it was best to minimize the amount of regret involved .  Feeling like he couldn’t be disappointed in something that he wanted, Jinwoo made a cold decision . </p>
<p>“Blessed Random Box . ”</p>
<p>A small box appeared at his feet . </p>
<p>Jinwoo picked it up . </p>
<p>‘Could it be…?’</p>
