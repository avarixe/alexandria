<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 72</p>
<p>‘Shall we get started?’</p>
<p>The Shadow Soldiers appeared behind Jinwoo’s back .  His army was composed of infantry, mages, beasts and the two knights .  At their head stood Jinwoo . The two knights stepped forward and took place at Jinwoo’s sides .  Ygritte to his right, Iron to his left . Looking at the pair, Jinwoo beamed with pride . </p>
<p>‘They’re rather dependable . ’</p>
<p>Even if it was his skill, they felt like comrades that protected his back .  It gave Jinwoo a sense of security . </p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>‘Facing that thing head on is a bit…’</p>
<p>Dangerous .  Mainly because of the giant wooden club that Volkhan was holding . </p>
<p>‘It’s amazing there’s a tree large enough to make that thing . ’</p>
<p>Taking Volkhan’s giant body and the size of the wooden club into account, a single swipe would wipe away his entire army . </p>
<p>‘Well, being wiped away is fine . ’</p>
<p>The problem was the limited amount of mana he had to regenerate his entire army .  Jinwoo knew his mana would plummet to the ground if he stupidly rushed at the demon with everyone at his disposal .  That left one option,</p>
<p>‘That musclehead is mine . ’</p>
<p>His army would take care of the trash mobs around Volkhan, while Jinwoo fought the giant demon on his own .  He felt that that was the best way to approach this fight . </p>
<p>‘I just have to not get hit . ’</p>
<p>Unlike his soldiers, Jinwoo was confident in his ability to dodge Volkhan’s attacks .  The Hunter ordered the Shadow Mages to fire the opening shot . </p>
<p>‘The ranged attacks will grab aggro from the trash mobs . When that slow looking thing lumbers behind the high-level demons, I’ll go fight it one-on-one . ’</p>
<p>It was a straight forward tactic . </p>
<p>‘Now . ’</p>
<p>When he gave the signal, fireballs shot out from the Shadow Mages’ hands . </p>
<p>wooosh-</p>
<p>wooooooosh-</p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>The fireball exploded near the mobs around Volkhan and signaled the start of battle . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>

<p>ring, ring, ring!</p>
<p>The warning tones came one after another repeatedly .  With the warning, Volkhan and the bodyguards turned their gazes toward Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Alright…’</p>
<p>They succeeded in grabbing the enemy’s attention .  Jinwoo activated ‘Stealth’; his plan was to flank around the trash mobs and get to Volkhan . </p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>Everything was going to plan . </p>
<p> . Or so he thought . </p>
<p>BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM-!</p>
<p>‘ . !!!’</p>
<p>Contrary to Jinwoo’s expectations, Volkhan was the first to run towards the Shadow Army .  If it wasn’t for the fact that they were about to engage in a difficult battle, it would’ve almost been comical sight .  Instead of lumbering slowly, the giant demon was running at full sprint towards them, almost as if,</p>
<p>‘What the hell?! What’s with its movement?! It’s like someone pressed fast forward on a video!’</p>
<p>Indeed, Volkhan had reached them in a blink of an eye! Leaving behind his bodyguards, the giant demon stopped before the Shadow Soldiers .  </p>
<p>‘I fucked up!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes opened wide .  The demon’s mountain-like body displayed a speed that betrayed all logic . </p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Volkhan raised its club and brought it down .  As the club fell down towards the exposed Shadow Mages, Iron appeared out nowhere and raised his pitch-black shield to block . </p>
<p>SMASH!</p>
<p>. <strong>CRACK!</strong>. </p>
<p>It was a valiant effort… While the giant knight managed to blocked the attack, Iron’s two arms were completely destroyed .  The Shadow Soldier with the highest defense was rendered useless after a single attack . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>Pieces of Iron’s two broken arms fell onto the ground . </p>
<p>“Mm? Mm?”</p>
<p>As if disappointed by its last attack, Volkhan tilted his head and squinted at his club .  Well, the demon’s confusion only lasted for a split second . The wooden club was brought down once more . </p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>CRACK!</p>
<p>With no way to defend anymore, Iron and the Shadow Mages behind him were crushed without resistance . </p>
<p>snap</p>
<p>Watching this scene, something snapped inside of Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘You fucking…’</p>
<p>The Hunter bit his lower lip .  His body moved before his mind could give the order . </p>
<p>jump!</p>
<p>Before he realized, Jinwoo was already in the air, flying towards Volkhan .  His target was clear . Compared to its mountain-like body, the demon’s head was tiny .  Jinwoo twisted his hips midair, pulling his right arm back . The muscles on the Hunter’s right arm and shoulder flexed .  As he focused every ounce of his strength into his clenched fist, ‘Stealth’ was released . </p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>Volkhan discovered Jinwoo too late .  Jinwoo was not about to miss a target at this range . </p>
<p>WOOSH-!</p>
<p>The man’s fist shot forth like a bullet into the side of Volkhan’s face . </p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>The body of the giant demon was thrown back .  The demon rolled on the ground for some time, finally stopping when it struck a building with only frames remaining . </p>
<p>Collapse!</p>
<p>What remained of the building collapsed when the giant demon crashed into it . </p>
<p>step</p>
<p>Jinwoo nimbly landed on the ground but was surprised . </p>
<p>‘Why did he fly so far?’</p>
<p>He looked down at his fist with disbelief .  There was not a scratch on the fist that blew away giant demon .  Then he realized,</p>
<p>‘Oh right…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked up .  The stat screen was pulled up . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 150</p>
<p>Constitution: 109</p>
<p>Agility: 139</p>
<p>Intelligence: 109</p>
<p><strong>Sense: 111</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>(Available stat points: 0)</strong>.   </p>
<p>Physical Damage Reduction: 46%</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘ . I forgot . ’</p>
<p>Because he had mostly received Assassin-class skills and obtained a Mage-class as his class, Jinwoo had forgotten about something:</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Strength: 150</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Even though he had invested every point into intelligence lately, his strength was still nearly 50% higher than intelligence . </p>
<p>‘I really invested a stupid amount of points into that, huh . ’</p>
<p>On top of that, he had explosively raised his levels in the past few days .  Looking at the stats, he was able to feel his growth . </p>
<p>And the results of that growth was… that .  Jinwoo looked at Volkhan’s body in the rubbles of the building in disbelief .  It was hard to tell when he fought the low-level and mid-level demons . But using his powers against the boss-level monster gave him assurance,</p>
<p>‘I… have become strong . ’</p>
<p>clench</p>
<p>Strength filled Jinwoo’s fist and spread throughout his entire body .  Suddenly, the familiar electronic tone rang,</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>‘What is it?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo raised his head . </p>
<p>“Mm? Mm?”</p>
<p>Volkhan used its club as a support and rose from the ground . </p>
<p>‘Is it warning me that a monster is getting up?’</p>
<p>Had the System ever been that friendly? With a tilted head, Jinwoo realized the true meaning of the System’s warning tone . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Overlord of the Lower Floors, Volkhan of Avarice has used ‘Rage’ . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>ring, ring, ring</p>
<p>The warning tones continued . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>It will permanently enter a state of rage . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Volkhan’s all attributes are increased by 50% . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Volkhan cannot feel any pain . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘That skill is…?’</p>
<p>Before even Jinwoo could recall the memories of Cerberus, Volkhan charged at him with blood-red eyes . </p>
<p>BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM-!</p>
<p>The ground shook with each deafening footstep .  Jinwoo took a quick glance back; his Shadow Soldiers and Volkhan’s minions were in a fierce battle . </p>
<p>“Guoooo!”</p>
<p>“Kiiek!”</p>
<p>Amidst the chaotic battle, Jinwoo found Iron .  As a testament to Volkhan’s destructive power, the giant knight was still in the middle of regenerating . </p>
<p>“Iron!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo shouted .  His knight immediately understood his liege’s order .  Iron threw his shield with strength towards Jinwoo . The Hunter quickly snatched it out of the air .  When he turned his gaze forward again, Volkhan was already before him . </p>
<p>‘If I dodge, my soldiers will be hit . ’</p>
<p>It would be impossible to take down Volkhan and his minions without his army .  And so, Jinwoo selected the best method to protect his soldiers . He raised his shield and focused strength into his arms . </p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Volkhan’s club fell . </p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>The brutal attacks that made the earth cry rained down mercilessly on Jinwoo, but the Hunter held his ground .  It was only made possible due to his high physical damage reduction and constitution stats . </p>
<p>“Mm? Mm?”</p>
<p>Enraged that his attacks were ineffective, Volkhan started swinging his club with fury . </p>
<p>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</p>
<p>However, Jinwoo’s knees did not buckle . </p>
<p>‘Still…’</p>
<p>Just blocking like this would never bring down that mountain .  Jinwoo’s brows furrowed . Unlike Cerberus, Volkhan’s ‘Rage’, while it was less effective than the dog’s, did not have a time limit .  He could not wait for it to time out like last time . </p>
<p>BANG! BANG!</p>
<p>Jinwoo clenched his teeth . </p>
<p>‘Not really my style to be a Tanker anyways…’</p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>The moment Volkhan’s club retracted for the next blow, Jinwoo leaped towards demon’s head again .  However, Jinwoo wasn’t the only one looking for an opportunity . </p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Timing its movements, Volkhan stepped back as Jinwoo flew towards him . </p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo saw the club swinging towards him horizontally . </p>
<p>‘ . He got me . ’</p>
<p>If he was on the ground, it would’ve been a different story .  But there was no way to dodge midair . Even if he blocked, he would be smashed into something . </p>
<p>woooooooosh-!</p>
<p>In a world of slowed time, Jinwoo saw the club making its way to him in slow motion . </p>
<p>‘Is there anything I could do?!’</p>
<p>If only he could move his body somehow .  Suddenly, a thought flashed across his mind,</p>
<p>‘If I could only move my body?’</p>
<p>There was no time to think .  Jinwoo quickly used ‘Ruler’s Hands’ to try and push Volkhan . </p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>Of course, moving that mountainous body with his current level of proficiency was impossible .  However, the rebounding force instead pushed Jinwoo’s body back . </p>
<p>woooosh-!</p>
<p>The tip of the club passed before his eyes . </p>
<p>‘Thank you Newton ahjussi!’</p>
<p>Because of the erratic movement, Jinwoo lost his balance and rolled on the ground for a bit, but it was nothing compared to the damage he would’ve received if he was struck by the attack . </p>
<p>“Phew-!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo collected himself and sighed in relief . </p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Volkhan’s face scrunched hideously in anger .  Missing its planned attack made every inch of its body tremble in rage . </p>
<p>“Mm, Mm!”</p>
<p>Looking at the demon’s face turning red, Jinwoo scratched the side of his head . </p>
<p>‘Now what?’</p>
<p>It just displayed the ability to dodge when he jumped at its head .  Additionally, it did not feel like Jinwoo could do much damage to the rest of its body considering its size .  </p>
<p>‘Is there anyway I can prevent it from dodging?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo thought of an idea .  The corners of his mouth rose .  The Hunter turned around and ran .  Mistaking it for Jinwoo trying to escape, Volkhan rapidly chased after him . </p>
<p>BOOM BOOM BOOM-!</p>
<p>Jinwoo controlled his pace so Volkhan could follow right behind him .  His eyes lit up when he found a suitable building . </p>
<p>‘That should work . ’</p>
<p>Meanwhile,</p>
<p>“MM!”</p>
<p>As the distance between it and Jinwoo closed, the demon swung his club . </p>
<p>This insectile existence!</p>
<p>The chance to crush this annoyance was here .  A disgusting smile appeared on Volkhan’s face .  But as his club fell down towards the ground, the insect suddenly sped up and ran up the side of a crumbling building . </p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>Something felt off, but it was too late to slow down . </p>
<p>“Mm, mm?”</p>
<p>The insect on the building reached the demon’s eye level, then kicked off the building with all his might . </p>
<p>CRACK!</p>
<p>The wall he kicked off of cracked like a spider’s web, and something flew toward Volkhan’s face faster than it could react .  It was the insect . </p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Volkhan’s eyes widened .  Jinwoo met its eyes with a smile .  Wielding Baruka’s Tanto in his right hand, Jinwoo sliced the bulging artery on demon’s neck . </p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>As fitting of its large body, blood spilled out like a fountain from the wound .  </p>
<p>splash!</p>
<p>“Mm? Mm!”</p>
<p>Volkhan threw away its club and quickly put a hand over the wound . </p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>However, it was not enough to stop the bleeding .  The giant demon’s eyes began to tremble . </p>
<p>“M-mm?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo had already climbed behind its back and used his two daggers to stab the demon’s neck . </p>
<p>‘Is once not enough?’</p>
<p>With a tilted head, Jinwoo used the skill again . </p>
<p>‘Vital Stab!’</p>
<p>The two daggers dug into Volkhan’s neck again . </p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>And finally, the victorious message appeared . </p>
