<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 63</p>
<p>“Jinwoo oppa!”</p>
<p>Han Songyi’s eyes were filled with tears as she greeted Jinwoo with joy . </p>
<p>“Raid Leader!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t as much as the girl’s reaction, but the two male Hunters also greeted him happily .  Park Heejin sighed in relief after realizing Jinwoo was here . However, Jinwoo did not have the luxury to return their greeting,</p>
<p>“Shh . ”</p>
<p>He put a finger to his lips .  Halfway to rushing him and giving him a hug, the four Hunters froze up at Jinwoo’s gesture .  Park Heejin asked,</p>
<p>“W-what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo glanced over to to the passed out Kim Cheol .  The E-rank Hunter was still furious at the man, feeling like he could beat him to death without blinking .  </p>
<p>“Kim Cheol was followed . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo felt a powerful presence coming from the forest .  Now was not the time to be concerned about Kim Cheol . The real problem was coming from the distance . </p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>Realizing Jinwoo was looking directly at them, the White Walkers released ‘Stealth’ and showed themselves .  There were about 20 of them . One of them stood out from the rest . Jinwoo stared at the White Walker with long hair flowing down to its waist on top of a horse .  </p>
<p>‘ . He’s the boss . ’</p>
<p>Compared to the ice bears or even the White Walkers next to him, the long hair was giving off an oppressive amount of pressure .  If this wasn’t the boss of the Dungeon, who else could it be? It had been a long time, but a chill ran down Jinwoo’s back . While Jinwoo lightly trembled at the thing’s power, the boss also observed Jinwoo,</p>
<p>[“So it was true . The trash ended up being useful after all . ”]</p>
<p>[“What did you say?”]</p>
<p>[“ . ?”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo had replied without realizing, and the boss was shocked . </p>
<p>[“You . You speak our language?”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo was equally shocked,</p>
<p>‘How am I communicating with a magic beast?’</p>
<p>He was able to understand the magic beast’s language .  Not only that, he was in fact able to speak it . Words that he had never learned were flowing out of him like it was his native tongue . </p>
<p>“You… You can speak the language of the magic beasts?”</p>
<p>Park Heejin was running out of things to be surprised by from Jinwoo .  Her question gave Jinwoo confirmation that he was indeed speaking and understanding the magic beast’s language . </p>
<p>‘Is this also an effect of the System?’</p>
<p>Something like a universal translator .  Jinwoo looked back at the boss . The boss was looking at him with an amused face . </p>
<p>[“So we can communicate… How interesting . There is someone I want to introduce to you . ”]</p>
<p>The boss gestured behind him to a White Walker . </p>
<p>[“I believe you are already acquainted . ”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes sharpened .  Indeed, he was familiar with this one . </p>
<p>‘That bastard is…’</p>
<p>It was the ice elf that shot an arrow towards Han Songyi when their group had first entered the Gate .  He could not forget that arrogant face . Just like back then, a sneer decorated its lips . </p>
<p>[“He has told me that there was someone strong among the humans . He wished to duel that someone, so-”]</p>
<p>pierce!</p>
<p>The smiling face of the White Walker was now decorated with Knight Killer sticking out of it . </p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The scream came from the Hunters’ side .  Yoon Gijoong quickly covered his mouth after screaming without meaning to . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>The White Walker fell .  Jinwoo stretched a hand toward its corpse .  The dagger that was stuck to its head lightly trembled, then shot forth into Jinwoo’s hand .  Jinwoo grabbed the Knight Killer in a reverse grip and took a combat stance,</p>
<p>[“Anything else?”]</p>
<p>The boss spoke with awe,</p>
<p>[“ . You truly are strong . ”]</p>
<p>And got down from the horse .  However, the boss did not appear to want to fight yet; it did not raise a weapon or give off a sense of hostility . </p>
<p>[“However you should know . ”]</p>
<p>With a carefree expression, it continued their conversation,</p>
<p>[“That even you cannot win against this number . ”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked over the ice elves .  There were at least 20 of them . But their numbers weren’t what concerned him .  It was the strength of the boss . The trash mobs around the boss were no match for Jinwoo, who had greatly raised his levels while hunting the ice bears .  As a testament, Jinwoo had just killed a White Walker with but a throw of his dagger . </p>
<p>‘So what to do about the boss?’</p>
<p>While Jinwoo ran the simulations in his mind, the boss continued,</p>
<p>[“I have a proposal . ”]</p>
<p>[“A proposal?”]</p>
<p>[“Yes . I think you’ll find it to your benefit as well . ”]</p>
<p>[“ . ”] [1]</p>
<p>Jinwoo was surprised .  He knew that humanoid magic beasts had some semblance of intelligence, but he had never thought that they would attempt to bargain with a human being .  His curiosity got the best of him,</p>
<p>[“ . Let’s hear it . ”]</p>
<p>The boss smiled as expecting that response,</p>
<p>[“Before that, I have a question . ”]</p>
<p>[“ . ?”]</p>
<p>[“You are not human . Why are you among the humans?”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s brows furrowed . </p>
<p>[“The hell are you talking about?”]</p>
<p>[“Ha ha . Are you not aware?”]</p>
<p>The boss chuckled then pointed to its temple . </p>
<p>[“In our head, there is a voice whispering to us without rest . It tells us to ‘kill all humans’ . But in front of you, the voice becomes silent . ”]</p>
<p>Ah .  Is that so? If that was the case, Jinwoo had a rough theory,</p>
<p>‘The word “human” is probably referring to Hunters . ’</p>
<p>On the other hand, after coming out of the underground temple with the System, Jinwoo’s identity had probably changed to a “Player” .  In a strict sense, he was probably registered differently than Hunters, aka Awakened Beings . </p>
<p>‘That’s why he’s mistakenly thinking I’m not human . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo thought he was right on the mark .  Mistaking the look on Jinwoo’s face for agreement, the boss nodded,</p>
<p>[“There is no need for us to fight . We want to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed in our end . ”]</p>
<p>The boss got to the point,</p>
<p>[“Give us the humans behind you . Then we will let you leave here alive . How about it? Do you accept our proposal?”]</p>
<p>Instead of an answer, Jinwoo asked a question,</p>
<p>[“Let me also ask one thing . ”]</p>
<p>[“Very well . ”] </p>
<p>[“Who are you people? Where did you come from and why are you trying to kill humans?”]</p>
<p>[“We are-”]</p>
<p>Suddenly, the smiling face of the boss froze for a split second .  Then he continued naturally as if nothing had happened,</p>
<p>[“There is no need for us to fight . We want to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed in our end”]</p>
<p>‘What was that?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo narrowed his eyes .  The boss reacted like an NPC in a video game, forced into repeating his words after trying to act outside of his program . </p>
<p>[“Give us the humans behind you . Then we will let you leave here alive . How about it? Do you accept our proposal?”]</p>
<p>The boss’s face showed no indication that something had happened .  It continued to maintain its carefree smile . The White Walkers behind him also did not show any reaction . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>When Jinwoo just observed the situation in silence, the boss pressed his question,</p>
<p>[“Do you accept?”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo wanted to obtain some information about the magic beasts and their goals but realized it would be futile . </p>
<p>‘In that case…’</p>
<p>There was only one thing left .  His reply was already determined a long time ago . </p>
<p>[“I refuse . ”]</p>
<p>The corners of Jinwoo’s mouth rose . </p>
<p>‘You see, you’ve got such a delicious looking shadow for me to just let you walk away . ’</p>
<p>He would defeat the boss and take its shadow .  From the moment he laid his eyes on the long hair, this was his plan . </p>
<p>[“You want to fight me and my soldiers? Do you think that you could withstand our numbers?”]</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled widely . </p>
<p>Soldiers?</p>
<p>‘You think you’re the only one? I got some too . Shadow corp, come forth . ’</p>
<p>Following his will, the soldiers waiting in Jinwoo’s shadow appeared behind him . </p>
<p>“U-uwaaak!”</p>
<p>Once again, the scream came from the Hunters’ side .  Yoon Gijoong screamed after seeing the ice bear’s shadow, the Shadow Beast, and fell on his rear . </p>
<p>“Ah- ah…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo glanced over at the pale faces of his teammates and felt a little bad .  But this was a dangerous moment, there was no time to explain . </p>
<p>‘Not that I would explain even if there was no danger . ’</p>
<p>There were 29 Shadow Soldiers .  Jinwoo stood at their head and leered at the boss,</p>
<p>[“So . Who’s withstanding whose numbers?”]</p>
<p>The boss finally emitted hostility,</p>
<p>[“ . You wield but a mere parlor trick . Very well, I will fulfill your death wish . ”]</p>
<p>The boss took out the two tanto [2] at its side .  Jinwoo mirrored its action and held Knight Killer in his right hand and Casaka’s Poisoned Fang in his left . </p>
<p>‘A parlor trick . ’</p>
<p>Well, Jinwoo didn’t disagree .  The shadow army might have the advantage in numbers, but he knew that their overall might was lacking compared to the boss .  He understood where the boss’s confidence was coming from . He needed a powerful reinforcement . </p>
<p>‘Wait, if it’s a powerful reinforcement I need…’</p>
<p>There was someone fitting .  Jinwoo quickly glanced over to his side .  Kim Cheol was still passed out over there . </p>
<p>[“Attack!”]</p>
<p>At the boss’s command, the White Walkers aimed their bows . </p>
<p>“Bears!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo placed the Shadow Beasts in front . </p>
<p>Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!</p>
<p>Kuwaak!</p>
<p>The Shadow Beasts baptised by arrows cried out .  Before the White Walkers could draw their next round, the Shadow Infantry charged forth .  The Shadow Mages also began their casting . Jinwoo’s eyes flared,</p>
<p>‘My target is you!’</p>
<p>Before heading out, Jinwoo quickly kicked over Kim Cheol’s sword to the passed out Hunter .  Jinwoo’s gaze was fixed on the boss and the boss’s on Jinwoo . The four daggers clashed in a magnificent display of sparks . </p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Cla-clang!</p>
<p>Around them, the skirmish between the Shadow Soldiers and the White Walkers raged . </p>
<p>Go Myunghwan turned to Park Heejin,</p>
<p>“Should… Should we also help out?”</p>
<p>The woman shook her head,</p>
<p>“This is not a fight that we should be joining . ”</p>
<p>It was a chaotic battlefield where giant black monsters were swinging their claws, destroyed black soldiers were instantly regenerating and high-level magic beasts were mercilessly attacking with swords and arrows . </p>
<p>‘What could we, a B-ranker and two C-rankers, even do in this situation?’</p>
<p>All they could do was pray .  Park Heejin stared at the form of Jinwoo clashing with the long haired White Walker . </p>
<p>“Kuk!”</p>
<p>A yelp escaped from Jinwoo’s mouth .  This was indeed a high-level Dungeon’s boss! A casual observer might think that they were evenly matched, but Jinwoo was slowly being pushed back .  Various cuts appeared here and there on his body . Could he hold out for another three minutes? Even as he fought the boss, the regeneration of his army continued to drain his mana . </p>
<p>The Shadow Mages had finished casting their spell .  A fireball much bigger than a volleyball fell into the middle of the White Walkers . </p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>It was the power of the leveled up mages .  The deafening sound of the explosion woke up Kim Cheol . </p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>He raised his head . </p>
<p>Clang! Clang! Bam! Boom!</p>
<p>In his blurred vision, he saw the terrifying White Walkers fighting unknown black soldiers . </p>
<p>‘What…the hell . is this?’</p>
<p>He had no idea what was going on, but he knew why he was on the ground .  The hand that struck him on the back of his head! That voice he heard while falling down!</p>
<p>‘It was Sung Jinwoo!’</p>
<p>Once he regained consciousness, the humiliation and the rage he felt made his hands tremble .  His hands found their way to his sword that was conveniently right next to him . Now that they were surrounded by the White Walkers, they were all as good as dead .  At the very least,</p>
<p>‘Sung Jinwoo . I will kill that fucker before I die . ’</p>
<p>His heated gaze found Jinwoo’s back . </p>
<p> . Found him!</p>
<p>The fucker was fighting a White Walker, and his back was wide open .  This was his chance . Kim Cheol shot up from the ground and ran forth . </p>
<p>“Waaaaaah-!’</p>
<p>Sensing the powerful reinforcement running to him, Jinwoo celebrated in his mind,</p>
<p>‘Yes, if it’s you . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo believed in Kim Cheol . </p>
<p>Kim Cheol reached Jinwoo and swung his sword at the E-rank Hunter’s neck with all his might . </p>
<p>“DIE!”</p>
<p>The boss in front of him, Kim Cheol behind him .  Seemingly between a rock and a hard place, Jinwoo shouted,</p>
<p>“Ygritte!”</p>
<p>As if waiting, Ygritte rose from Jinwoo’s shadow and deflected Kim Cheol’s sword . </p>
<p>clang!</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol’s eyes widened, revealing the bloodshot whites .  Before he could say anything, Ygritte’s sword dug itself deeply into the A-ranker’s chest . </p>
<p>staaaab!</p>
<p>The sword pierced straight through the muscular man and came out of his back . </p>
<p>“cough!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly backed away from the boss . </p>
<p>‘Yes . I believed in you, Kim Cheol . I believed that this is exactly how you would act . ’</p>
<p>A foolish man who moved according to his feelings without thinking about the future .  In a short time, Jinwoo fully understood what kind of a man Kim Cheol was . Kim Cheol glared at Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“You… you…”</p>
<p>And those were Kim Cheol’s final words . </p>
<p>White Ygritte was keeping the boss busy, Jinwoo stood before Kim Cheol’s body,</p>
<p>“Arise!”</p>
<p>uwaaaaah-</p>
<p>The familiar deep scream rang forth from somewhere . </p>
<p>With it, a giant hand came out of Kim Cheol’s shadow . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: Ever see those unnecessary closed caption describing a sound with too much detail, like “Brooding in Spanish”? Well, Jinwoo is “being silent in language of the magic beasts” here :P</p>
<p>[2]: “Tanto” (단도): A japanese knife . </p>
