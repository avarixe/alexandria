<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 64</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve succeeded in Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Of course!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo clenched his fists .  The path to victory of this battle was a puzzle .  And the last piece of that puzzle just fell into place .  The black knight that rose from Kim Cheol’s shadow was much bigger and thicker than his base .  One hand wielded a giant hammer . The other hand held a shield the size of an adult . The knight gave off an incredible sense of danger . </p>
<p>‘Man, I know Kim Cheol was a musclehead, but this thing is…’</p>
<p>Even in the tense situation, Jinwoo could not help but be amazed . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Please choose a name for the soldier . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Oh right, name . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo took a quick glance at side .  Ygritte was being pushed back by the boss; his regeneration was the only thing keeping him in the fray . </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<p>One of Ygritte’s arms were cut off . </p>
<p>‘Shoot, I have to hurry . ’</p>
<p>Name . </p>
<p>Should he just use the man’s name? Jinwoo shook his head . No, it was rather distasteful to use the human being’s name on his undead form . </p>
<p>‘Oh wait, Kim Cheol . Cheol is iron, so Iron!’ [1]</p>
<p>He decided on the name .  The moment he made his decision, the newly born shadow earned its name . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Iron (Lv . 1)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Knight Grade</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Knight grade! It was the same as Ygritte, but now was not the time to celebrate . </p>
<p>‘No time to dilly dally!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo raised a chin at the boss,</p>
<p>“Iron!”</p>
<p>Iron moved his large body and stepped forward . </p>
<p>STEP! STEP! STEP!</p>
<p>Its giant body was filled with power, but there was no way that this lumbering thing was going to face that nimble boss .  However, Iron exceeded Jinwoo’s expectations . The giant knight thrust out his chest and roared,</p>
<p>WAAAAAAH-!</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>A message appeared in front of the confused Jinwoo . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Iron has used ‘Taunting Shout’ . [2]</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The boss has been taunted . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“A taunt skill!”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol was an A-rank Tanker .  As expected, he maintained a powerful aggro management skill, and Iron, his shadow, perfectly imitated that skill .  The boss’s head sharply turned to the giant knight . Leaving behind Ygritte, who it could’ve easily finished, the boss ran towards Iron as if possessed by a ghost .  Iron followed up with ‘Strengthen’ and endured the boss’s attacks . </p>
<p>‘Good job!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded in approvement .  Meanwhile, Ygritte’s arm regenerated .  Black smoke seeped from the wound then reformed into the knight’s arm .  The boss was still focused on Iron . Jinwoo and Ygritte began their combination attack . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Park Heejin was at a complete loss for words .  The scene unfolding before her was outside of reality .  She lost the strength to be even curious at this point . At her side, Han Songyi asked a question with a tiny voice,</p>
<p>“Unni…”</p>
<p>It took Park Heejin a moment to respond,</p>
<p>“Huh? Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Are… are all Hunters’ fights like this?”</p>
<p>The girl’s voice filled with fear was shaking .  Park Heejin’s response was a little curt,</p>
<p>“ . If that was the case, do you think I would’ve gotten my license?”</p>
<p>Go Myunghwan uttered with a blank look in his eyes,</p>
<p>“Are… are we in a dream?”</p>
<p>If this was a dream, it was definitely a nightmare .  Park Heejin could only watch the magic beasts fighting “something” clad in pitch black with an open mouth .  At the same time, a worry appeared in her mind,</p>
<p>‘Once we get out, we’ll definitely…’</p>
<p>As survivors, they’ll be thoroughly interviewed and investigated .  How would she explain all of this? Thinking about the things Sung Jinwoo had shown them in this place, she could not imagine how the brass will react .  She voiced all of this to her fellow Hunters . </p>
<p>“But you know,”</p>
<p>Trembling while sitting on the ground, Yoon Gijoong opened his mouth with difficulty,</p>
<p>“The fact that we’re worrying about what we’ll do “once we get out” . Isn’t that amazing?”</p>
<p>The party members nodded in unison . </p>
<p>They were in a high-level Dungeon, a Red Gate on top of that .  The moment they were thrown aside by Kim Cheol, they were only dreading their deaths .  But now, they were actually worrying about the outside as if leaving here alive was guaranteed .  This was all thanks to one man . Park Heejin turned her gaze to Jinwoo,</p>
<p>‘Sung Jinwoo-ssi, you…’</p>
<p>The awe in her heart surpassed her gratitude and surprise . </p>
<p>Stab!</p>
<p>Casaka’s Poisoned Fang struck the boss’s shoulder . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Paralysis has been inflicted . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The target’s resistance was too high . Effect cancelled . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Lately, because his opponents had become a lot stronger, Casaka’s Poisoned Fang’s special effects did not take most of the time .  Still, leaving a wound was good enough . </p>
<p>‘Good!’</p>
<p>As more and more wounds appeared on its body, the boss’s movements began to slow down . </p>
<p>[“Kwaak!”]</p>
<p>The smile had long since disappeared from the ice elf’s face .  It had taken on Jinwoo, Ygritte and Iron on its own and was now panting . </p>
<p>‘Just a bit more!’</p>
<p>Suddenly, Iron succeeded in pulling the boss in to a bear hug . </p>
<p>“Now!”</p>
<p>At Jinwoo’s signal, both Jinwoo and Ygritte fell back .  The boss’s eyes widened,</p>
<p>[“What are you…?”]</p>
<p>The finished spells of the Shadow Mages fell upon Iron . </p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>KABOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>[“COUGH!”] [3]</p>
<p>For the first time, the boss betrayed signs of its pain .  The ice elf twisted his body and Iron’s arms were blown off . </p>
<p>crack!</p>
<p>The boss sent a venomous glare at Jinwoo . </p>
<p>[“KWAAAAK!”] [4]</p>
<p>Jinwoo was once again in awe of the boss’s strength . </p>
<p>‘Even with that much damage, he’s still able to pull out this much power!’</p>
<p>It was truly the boss of a high-level Dungeon .  However, the scales of the battle had already tipped towards Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Dagger Throw!’</p>
<p>Just like how he took care of that arrogant White Walker, Knight Killer flew towards the boss .  Jinwoo even used the ‘Ruler’s Hands’ to supplement its speed . </p>
<p>woosh-!</p>
<p>The dagger reached the boss in a flash . </p>
<p>[‘Keuk!’]</p>
<p>Realizing it could not dodge, the boss deflected the dagger with its tanto . </p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>As a testament to the Knight Killer’s speed, a large crack appeared in the blocking tanto . </p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>Having closed the gap to the boss using ‘Stealth’ and ‘Sprint’, Jinwoo stabbed the ice elf’s ribs with Casaka’s Poisoned Fang . </p>
<p>Stab!</p>
<p>The boss’s eyes widened in pain,</p>
<p>[“COUGH!”]</p>
<p>Even still, the ice elf grabbed Jinwoo’s wrist .  Its eyes screamed that it would not die without leaving a mark . </p>
<p>[“KAAAAH!”]</p>
<p>The boss raised its tanto over Jinwoo’s head .  Jinwoo sneered brightly in its face . </p>
<p>The giant hammer swung down on the ice elf’s head . </p>
<p><strong>CRASH!</strong>.  . </p>
<p>With a sickening crunch, the boss’s head was slammed into the snow .  Behind it was Iron with his giant hammer, his arms already regenerated .  The giant knight raised his hammer again and brought it down . </p>
<p>CRASH!</p>
<p>Ygritte was also preparing to attack but then put away his sword .  Jinwoo also returned his daggers to the inventory . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>CRASH!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated the boss of the Dungeon . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Phew, it’s finally over . ’</p>
<p>CRASH!</p>
<p>Jinwoo sighed in relief .  It was a difficult fight . He was about to collect his breath but then noticed Iron . </p>
<p>“Hey, hey, that’s enough . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly stopped the newest member of his army .  Iron was about to bring down his hammer again and stopped .  Just like his base, it seemed like the giant knight was… slow in more ways than one . </p>
<p>The boss’s corpse was an unrecognizable, mangled mess . </p>
<p>‘Well, there’s no problem with its shadow . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled widely again .  His reward after a difficult fight was waiting beneath his feet . </p>
<p>The Hunter gave the command with a subdued voice,</p>
<p>“Arise . ”</p>
<p>It was already 3 AM . </p>
<p>The faces of the four men guarding the area were dark .  Unable to take it any longer, Hyun Gicheol spoke up,</p>
<p>“We’ll keep watch here, why don’t you turn in for the night, Guildmaster?”</p>
<p>“The members of my Guild are in there . How could I rest in a time like this?”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho was determined . As a master of the Guild and as an S-rank Hunter, he could not leave this spot .  Suddenly, Ahn Sangmin shouted in surprise,</p>
<p>“What? The Red Gate!”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol and Joo Sungchan also noticed at the same time,</p>
<p>“The Red Gate is opening!”</p>
<p>“They cleared the Dungeon!”</p>
<p>“People… people are coming out!”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho clenched his fist . </p>
<p>‘Kim Cheol! Kim Cheol, he’s done it!’</p>
<p>The four men all ran to the Gate .  Unable to hide his excitement, Baek Yoonho looked for Kim Cheol’s face among the survivors .  However, even after everyone had exited the Gate, he could not find Kim Cheol . </p>
<p>‘Huh? Something’s wrong . ’</p>
<p>Even Joo Sungchan, who told everyone to believe in Kim Cheol, lost his confident attitude and put on a confused expression . </p>
<p>“Hunter Park Heejin-nim! Hunters Go Myunghwan-nim, Yoon Gijoong-nim!”</p>
<p>“Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim!!!”</p>
<p>Seeing Jinwoo follow Han Songyi out of the Gate, a smile bloomed on Ahn Sangmin’s face . </p>
<p>‘As I thought!’</p>
<p>Joo Sungchan and Ahn Sangmin’s moods had completely flipped from hours ago .  However, the smile quickly disappeared from Ahn Sangmin’s face . After the five Hunters, including Sung Jinwoo, came out of the Gate, the Gate quickly disappeared into oblivion . </p>
<p>“It can’t be… are the ones here it?”</p>
<p>With a defeated face, Jinwoo nodded .  Hyun Gicheol, who had asked the question, froze . </p>
<p>‘It can’t be…’</p>
<p>With tears forming in his eyes, Hyun Gicheol began to cross off the names of the deceased in the party list .  It was a sad job, but someone had to do it . Baek Yoonho was dumbfounded,</p>
<p>‘Only the low-rankers came back? Not even the A-ranker and only one B-ranker?’</p>
<p>It was impossible .  Just what happened in there?</p>
<p>“Let’s go, I’ll take you home . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was about to leave the scene of the incident with Han Songyi when Baek Yoonho grabbed his wrist . </p>
<p>“Excuse me, hold on a minute-”</p>
<p>woosh!</p>
<p>Jinwoo threw aside the S-ranker’s grip, and Baek Yoonho’s eyes turned sharp . </p>
<p>“Can we talk for a minute?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned around,</p>
<p>“I’m a little tired right now . If you have anything to ask, talk to your Guild members . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho could not take it anymore .  He revealed his identity to Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“I am Baekho’s Guildmaster, Hunter Baek Yoonho . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes maintained their coldness,</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>At Jinwoo’s cold reply, Baek Yoonho’s irises flickered and turned into that of a magic beast’s .  They were an inhuman, beastly eyes . </p>
<p>“We’ve just lost nine Guild members because of this incident . As the Guildmaster, I have the right to ask you some questions . ”</p>
<p>This was not a request . </p>
<p>An order . </p>
<p>In a way, a threat . </p>
<p>No matter what, Baek Yoonho had no intentions of letting Jinwoo leave that easily .  But suddenly, Jinwoo flared his eyes . He was not pushed back in any way by the S-ranker’s genuine hostility . </p>
<p>“And I just saved three of your Guild members . If you’re their leader, shouldn’t you be thanking me before anything else?”</p>
<p>At the stifling pressure the E-rank Hunter was giving off, the S-rank Hunter retracted his hostility .  The man was right . Baek Yoonho had no room to argue . </p>
<p>“ . I apologize . ”</p>
<p>As Baek Yoonho bowed his head, Jinwoo turned around again . </p>
<p>“Han Songyi, we’re going . ’</p>
<p>“Okay . ”</p>
<p>The student carefully followed after Jinwoo while making glances at Baek Yoonho .  Soon, the pair got in the van they had arrived in and left the scene of the incident . </p>
<p>‘What just happened…’</p>
<p>His thoughts in chaos, Baek Yoonho quickly ran toward the sole high-ranker of the survivors . </p>
<p>“Excuse me, Park Heejin-ssi . ”</p>
<p>The woman was warming her body with some tea provided by Hyun Gicheol and raised her head . </p>
<p>“What was with that man? Why was he so mad?”</p>
<p>Their party had overcome all odds and should’ve left the Gate happily with their lives, so why was Jinwoo filled with so much anger? Park Heejin shook her head,</p>
<p>“I’m not sure… He took down the boss and yelled something three times in front of the corpse… Then he got really mad after that…”</p>
<p>“And he was fine until then?”</p>
<p>Park Heejin looked over to Go Myunghwan and Yoon Gijoong .  The two men nodded in unison . </p>
<p>“What a strange man…”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho uttered while staring off into the distance where Jinwoo had disappeared off to .  Ahn Sangmin approached his boss as if Jinwoo’s bad mood was his fault,</p>
<p>“I apologize, Guildmaster . I’m sure he was just tired after everything . In my eyes, he’s not a bad person . ”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not the problem . ”</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho turned and faced Ahn Sangmin,</p>
<p>“Why have you not recruited that man yet?”</p>
<p>“S-sir?”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin could not hide his embarrassment .  But his embarrassment paled in comparison to Baek Yoonho’s . </p>
<p>‘Against me…’</p>
<p>The S-ranker recalled meeting Jinwoo’s eyes moments ago and gulped . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>If they had fought just now, Baek Yoonho was sure that he would have to be prepared to lose an arm . </p>
<p>‘Maybe even more…’</p>
<p>Realizing his Guildmaster’s meaning, Ahn Sangmin quickly replied,</p>
<p>“I’m currently doing my best . ”</p>
<p>“That’s not enough . ”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho’s eyes lit up . </p>
<p>Sung Jinwoo . </p>
<p>As expected, Chief Ahn’s eyes were never wrong . </p>
<p>“From now on, the full support of the Guild is at your disposal . You must bring that man into our fold . ”</p>
