<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 9</p>
<p>“Did you hurt your head?”</p>
<p>His little sister asked from the door .  Jinwoo shook his head . </p>
<p>“No . ”</p>
<p>Not comforted by his words, his sister’s eyes were filled with concern . </p>
<p>“You’re really okay, right?”</p>
<p>“I told you, yes . ”</p>
<p>His little sister huffed and puffed as she started approaching him with a piercing gaze .  Used to her reactions in situations like this, Jinwoo put up his guard as his little sister started hitting him . </p>
<p>“I told you to stop getting hurt! Do you know how much I was worried?!”</p>
<p>“…Sorry . ”</p>
<p>“Everyone else seems to do just fine, why are you the only one getting hurt all the time!”</p>
<p>“…Sorry…”</p>
<p>The hands that were striking him slowly lost their strength .  Eventually, Jinah stood with her head hung low, tears falling down her cheeks .  Jinwoo patted his sister on the back, doing his best to comfort her . He held back the tears forming in his own eyes . </p>
<p>‘To think I was prepared to die… to leave her behind…’</p>
<p>Thank god he had returned alive .  Looking at this moment, he realized just how many times he came close to death .  It was like being in a nightmare . </p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his gaze toward the words suspended in air . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You have unread messages . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘And it still feels like I haven’t woken up…’</p>
<p>He could not understand the meaning behind the words .  Still, what could he do? The most important thing was the fact that he was able to return to his family alive . </p>
<p>“Sniff”</p>
<p>Fortunately, his sister had stopped crying .  Unfortunately, her rant at his condition continued for another hour…</p>
<p>“-So do you understand? If you get hurt again, I’ll give up my studies and go straight into working, so you won’t be able to work as a Hunter ever again!”</p>
<p>A sharp, piercing gaze that was unbecoming of her pretty face, she was truly her brother’s sister . </p>
<p>“I got it, I got it . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded in resignation .  After receiving his confirmation multiple times, Jinah got up, satisfied . </p>
<p>“Where are you gong?”</p>
<p>“School .  I just got permission to leave briefly to come and see you, but I have to go back . ”</p>
<p>“Right, right .  The college entrance examinations are next year . ”</p>
<p>Although he could not afford to provide a tutor or send her to a private school, Jinah still managed to become one of the top students in the school .  Her goal: to become a doctor . The little girl who could not distance herself from video games suddenly became a fervent student when their mother fell ill few years ago . </p>
<p>Jinwoo wanted to make sure her dreams came true . </p>
<p>‘Wait… video games?’</p>
<p>His eyes suddenly shot open . </p>
<p>“I’m going . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly caught his sister, who was leaving,</p>
<p>“Jinah . ”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“When you play a game…”</p>
<p>Jinah smiled, “I don’t play games these days .  There’s so little time until I’m in my final year . ”</p>
<p>“I know, I know, but I still wanted to ask,”</p>
<p>“About what? Oppa, have you been playing games lately?”</p>
<p>Although she had put them behind, she was very good in her past .  As such, her brother’s question flared her interest . Jinwoo continued to stare at the floating letters and asked,</p>
<p>“If I have an unread message in a game, how do I open or access it?”</p>
<p>“First, you have to open the message box . ”</p>
<p>“Open the message box?”</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>The moment he spoke the words “open”, an electronic beep followed the opening of the message box . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You have 2 unread messages . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Welcome to becoming a [Player] . (Unread)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>[Daily Quest: The Preparation To Become Powerful] has arrived . (Unread)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo felt himself being filled with joy . </p>
<p>‘It worked!’</p>
<p>Surprised by the sudden appearance of happiness in his face, Jinah anxiously asked,</p>
<p>“What? What game is it? Do you need my help?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo firmly shook his head,</p>
<p>“No, I want to try it out alone . ”</p>
<p>How would his sister react if he told her everything that was happening to him?</p>
<p>‘Don’t want to hear from my own sister that I’m crazy . ’</p>
<p>So Jinwoo swallowed the words he wanted to say and bid her goodbye . </p>
<p>After confirming that she went down the elevator out of the hospital, Jinwoo returned to his room . </p>
<p>‘Can’t repeat the same mistake . ’</p>
<p>click-</p>
<p>lock-</p>
<p>To avoid any unwanted attention, he locked the doors .  Finishing his preparation, Jinwoo sat on the side of his bed and started reading the messages floating before his eyes . </p>

<p>The first message seemed familiar to him . </p>
<p>‘Where was it, I’ve definitely heard this one before . ’</p>
<p>He started with the first message . </p>
<p>‘Open . ’</p>
<p>ring~</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>He remembered now .  It was the words he heard before losing consciousness . </p>
<p>‘It said something about a player back then, too…’</p>
<p>But just like that time, he had no idea what that meant . </p>
<p>System .  Growth . Penalty .  Reward . </p>
<p>It was a parade of unclear meanings . </p>
<p>‘Just what is it helping grow, and what is it rewarding?’</p>
<p>He found it difficult to apply these words that he saw in video games before . </p>
<p>Ignoring the meaning of the words for now, he went onto the next message . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>[Daily Quest: The Preparation To Become Powerful] has arrived . (Unread)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Gulp . </p>
<p>Jinwoo swallowed at the suspicious title of the message .  His heartbeat sped up . </p>
<p>‘Open . ’</p>
<p>ring~</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>.  . </p>
<p>Jinwoo moaned after confirming the message . </p>
<p>“Sigh… what is this…”</p>
<p>Daily Quest .  On top of that, a “preparation to become powerful” .  He expected more than just simple exercises with a title like that .  At least, it was certain if he completed the exercises in the quest, his body would probably improve a little .  Was this the growth and reward the System spoke of?</p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it…’</p>
<p>He recalled reading “those with inner problems should listen to their inner voice” in some book before . </p>
<p>‘Guess I’m just hallucinating what my body’s telling me’</p>
<p>His urge to become stronger must’ve been so strong that he was now seeing these nonsensical words in the air .  More so than how laughable it was, he was disappointed . </p>
<p>“If you can just become strong like this, who wouldn’t have done so already…?”</p>
<p>He shook his head in disbelief .  He felt pathetic in the expectation that he would find all the answers in these messages . </p>
<p>‘Eh, I don’t care . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo went to lie down in the bed .  He stared up into the ceiling . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Although he was not doing anything in particular, time passed by quickly .  As he began to feel the weight of silence throughout the hospital, he suddenly sat up . </p>
<p>‘Still…’</p>
<p>What if this did bring about change? Half in anticipation, half in suspicion, the thought of ‘should I just give it a try’ occured in his head . </p>
<p>‘Can’t hurt after all . ’</p>
<p>What if he just lightly tried out one of the motions?</p>
<p>After some thought, he made the decision to give it a try . </p>
<p>Lightly stretching after getting off the bed, he attempted do half-hearted push-ups .  Instead of getting on the ground, he stood up at and angle and pushed off the bed . </p>
<p>“1, 2, 3…”</p>
<p>Starting at 1, he rapidly went down the line . </p>
<p>“ . 97, 98, 99, 100 . ”</p>
<p>Finishing what he started, he reached his 100th “push-up” .  Contrary to his expectation, nothing seemed to change . Except for his slightly sore arms . </p>
<p>“ . So now what…”</p>
<p>He stood up with a smile on his face . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Welcome to becoming a [Player] . (Read)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>[Daily Quest: The Preparation To Become Powerful] has arrived . (Read)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The previously “unread” messages had become “read” .  The words telling him that he had unread messages had disappeared, but he no longer had any intention to continue entertaining these delusions .  He felt he had done enough . </p>
<p>Without any regrets, he closed the message window . </p>
<p>With a yawn, he returned to his bed .  In response to moving after such a long time, he started feeling sleepy .  The window outside glowed orange from the sunset . </p>
<p>‘Is it this late already?’</p>
<p>The man from the Hunter Surveillance Department explained earlier that his hospital bills would be footed by the Association .  With that in mind, Jinwoo was not in a rush to be discharged . </p>
<p>‘Maybe I’ll have the hospital run some tests, make sure I’m completely healthy . ’</p>
<p>He thought as he lay in bed . </p>
<p>‘I’m sure the hallucinations should disappear after some time . ’</p>
<p>His eyelids slowly closed .  Soon, he fell into deep slumber . </p>
<p>tick tick tick </p>
<p>As he slept, the clock on the opposite wall continued to tick .  As time passed, the hands of the clock eventually pointed to 11:59:57 . </p>

<p>[You’ve failed to complete the Daily Quest .  You will be moved to the ‘Penalty Zone’ for a set duration . ]</p>
<p>SHAKE!~</p>
<p>Jinwoo opened his eyes to an intense trembling that shook his entire body . </p>
<p>“E-earthquake?!”</p>
<p>He shot up and grabbed the bed frame at the foot of the bed .  The trembling was so strong that he found it difficult to hold on . </p>
<p>SHAKE!~</p>
<p>But with each passing second, the tremors became worse . </p>
<p>Suddenly,</p>
<p>psssh~</p>
<p>The bed frame he held onto for his life broke .  No, it had disappeared from his hands . His checked his hands, there was no sign of the bed frame .  Instead, there was sand on his palms . </p>
<p>‘Sand?’</p>
<p>psssssh~</p>
<p>Rest of the frames on the bed turned to sand, and the trembling became even stronger . </p>
<p>SHAKE!~</p>
<p>“Uwaaak!”</p>
<p>Unable to hold on, he was eventually thrown off the bed .  Jinwoo screamed as he bounced up and down in his room . One by one, all the furniture and items in his room turned into sand . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>Crash!</p>
<p>Jinwoo suddenly found himself embedded in something .  His fingertips felt the softness of sand around him . The earthshake had stopped . </p>
<p>spit spit</p>
<p>As he spat out the sand that entered his mouth, he raised his head . </p>
<p>“ . ?”</p>
<p>He found himself in the middle of a vast desert .  Patting the sand off his body, he stood up and looked around . In every direction, he saw an endless field of sand, stretching to the horizon . </p>
<p>“A desert…?”</p>
<p>There was no logical explanation for this .  Until moments ago, he was resting on a hospital bed in the middle of Seoul . </p>
<p>He grabbed a handful of sand and let it fall .  The sand fell in a straight line to the ground . </p>
<p>‘There’s no wind . ’</p>
<p>Not just wind, looking up, there was no sun, moon or even stars . </p>
<p>An empty sky like black ink spilled across a canvas . </p>
<p>Even stranger, despite the lack of a visible light source, he had no trouble seeing his surroundings . </p>
<p>“Where am I?”</p>
