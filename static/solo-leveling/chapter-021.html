<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 21</p>
<p>‘His skin looks pretty tough… Wonder if I could damage it with this dagger . ’</p>
<p>The dagger had a shorter reach than the sword he used in the Instant Dungeon .  To inflict a deep wound with it, he would have to use a lot of strength . He flipped his grip on the dagger, holding it downwards .  This way, he felt like it’d be easier to do damage with it . </p>
<p>grrl . </p>
<p>The spider stopped before Jinwoo .  It raised its two front legs . Outstretched at its sides, its figure looked like a giant X from the front . </p>
<p>‘What is it trying to-’</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>If he did not instinctively move his body, his chest would’ve been pierced by the spider’s leg .  The spider quickly retracted its leg from the ground and assumed the striking position again . Bits and pieces of rock fell from the tip of his legs . </p>
<p>Jinwoo made a quick glance behind him .  The ground made of stone had a hole in it . </p>
<p>‘If I get hit by that, it won’t end in just pain . ’</p>
<p>His eyes flashed with readiness .  It was time to focus . </p>
<p>‘Here it comes again!’</p>
<p>wooooosh-!</p>
<p>He began to be able to see the legs that previously moved like bullets . </p>
<p>Left . </p>
<p>He lowered his head, evading a leg . </p>
<p>Right . </p>
<p>Turning his body to the side, he dodged the spider’s right leg and advanced a step . </p>
<p>Right again . </p>
<p>The leg aimed for his head again was dodged .  Jinwoo took two more steps . </p>
<p>Left . Right . Right . Left . Right . Right . Right . Left . Left . </p>
<p>slam! slam! slam! slam! slam! slam! slam! slam! slam! </p>
<p>The sound of the spider’s legs striking the ground stung his ears; bits and pieces of the ground flew in all directions .  Dodging the rain of assault, Jinwoo closed the gap with each step he took . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho could not believe his eyes . </p>
<p>“Who- who the hell is he?”</p>
<p>Even from a distance, the spider’s attacks raised the hair on the back of his head .  And this man was evading all the attacks while closing the gap at the same time . Jinwoo’s body that made no wasted movements was chilling . </p>
<p>“That’s an E-rank Hunter?”</p>
<p>No .  There was no way . </p>
<p>If he was standing in the place of Sung Jinwoo, his body would’ve been torn apart like rags .  He did not have the confidence to dodge a single attack . But Jinwoo was doing so without a single mistake .  An E-rank pulling off something that was impossible for a D-rank?</p>
<p>There was only one answer . </p>
<p>‘ . A false ranker!’ [1]</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho’s face darkened .  Of the skilled Hunters, there were those that could control their own magic power .  If they wanted, they could even hide their own rank . Purposely lowering their magic power, they would receive a lower rank than they should . </p>
<p>These people were called “false rankers” .  Most of them were known for their malicious intents . </p>
<p>‘I heard they were serial killers who enjoyed slaughtering low ranked Hunters in lower ranked Dungeons…’</p>
<p>Since only the people who had participated in the Raid would know what happened in the Dungeon, it was the perfect place to commit a crime . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho gulped .  Suddenly, Jinwoo was scarier than the spider . </p>
<p>‘Why did I come here…’</p>
<p>He felt like crying . </p>
<p>woosh! woosh! woosh! </p>
<p>The spider continued its attacks relentlessly .  Jinwoo became confident of his victory as he dodged the attacks .  As he closed the gap, bit by bit, the spider’s head entered his range .  Due to the simple pattern of the spider’s attack, he did not have that much difficulty . </p>
<p>‘First . Eyes . ’</p>
<p>Attacking the weakness of a magic beast was a Raid fundamental .  So he chose the eyes, which looked like the softest target . </p>
<p>‘Now to stab its eyes!’</p>
<p>It was as he made the decision .  The spider’s attacks seemed slow down . </p>
<p>woosh! woosh! </p>
<p>Did he get used to the attacks?</p>
<p>slam! slam!</p>
<p>No .  That was not it . </p>
<p>His eyes may be tricked, but not his ears .  The sound of the attacks striking the ground had definitely slowed a beat .  Even before his strengthening, Jinwoo was confident of his hearing . An uneasy feeling washed over him . </p>
<p>Looking closer, Jinwoo saw the spider’s mandibles twitching . </p>
<p>‘Why would it open its mouth in this timing?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo, who was about to leap 3 meters towards the spider’s head, felt that something was off .  Trusting his instincts, he jumped to the side, instead of up . </p>
<p>shaaaaaa-!</p>
<p>The spider spat out a murky fluid from its mouth .  Jinwoo rolled on the ground, got back on his feet and looked behind him . </p>
<p>The space where he was standing was now smoking and turning black . </p>
<p>shiiiiiii-</p>
<p>The stone that made up the ground was melting . </p>
<p>Jinwoo gulped . </p>
<p>‘If I jumped at its head just now…’</p>
<p>The stone would not be the only thing melting . </p>
<p>Sensing his agitation, the spider quickly turned towards Jinwoo . </p>
<p>skitter skitter skitter</p>
<p>The spider was already before him as he raised his head . </p>
<p>woosh!</p>
<p>Jinwoo jumped up from his spot, dodging the spider’s leg . </p>
<p>slam!</p>
<p>Its attack had started up again . </p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>He made the same movements as before, getting closer to the spider but was driven off again by the acid attack .  As another move was added to the spider’s attack pattern, the situation became difficult . </p>
<p>Acid if he got too close . </p>
<p>Legs if he kept his distance . </p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Frustrated, Jinwoo tried attacking the legs .  But his dagger could not even scratch the tough chitinous exterior . </p>
<p>Jinwoo bit his lips . </p>
<p>‘This is not going well . ’</p>
<p>While the spider was just using its two front legs to attack, Jinwoo was evading with his entire body .  It was obvious who would tire first . </p>
<p>‘Fatigue . ’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Fatigue: 57</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As expected, his fatigue was rapidly rising .  If it hit 70, his speed would slow down . Above 90, his breath would seize and it would become difficult to move .  Jinwoo was running out of time . </p>
<p>‘If I can just be a little faster…’</p>
<p>Speed . </p>
<p>Speed was the problem . </p>
<p>slam! slam! slam! slam! </p>
<p>‘Wait, speed?’</p>
<p>As he dodged the attacks by a hair’s breadth, a thought flashed across Jinwoo’s mind . </p>
<p>‘Right! There was that!’</p>
<p>The only active skill at his disposal .  He had forgotten about it until now, not having needed it . </p>
<p>‘Sprint!’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Sprint has been activated . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your movement speed is increased by 30% .  </strong>.   </p>
<p>While active, 1 mana will be used up every minute . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Accompanying the message, Jinwoo’s body became faster as if a booster was applied .  It became a lot easier to dodge the spider’s attacks . </p>
<p>woosh! woosh! woosh!</p>
<p>slam! slam! slam! </p>
<p>Dodging the lightning-like strikes of the spider legs, Jinwoo quickly came in front of the spider again .  Panicking, the spider sprayed the acid once more . </p>
<p>shaaaaaa-!</p>
<p>But to the sped-up Jinwoo, a breathing room appeared in his movements .  Easily dodging the acid spray, Jinwoo jumped towards the spider’s head . </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<p>The dagger flashed across the spider’s eyes . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Paralysis has been inflicted . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The target’s resistance was too high .  Effect cancelled . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>The special effect of the dagger, Casaka’s Poisoned Fang, was successfully applied . </p>
<p>screeeech!</p>
<p>The spider howled and twisted its body .  Jinwoo did not miss the opportunity . Landing on the ground, he immediately jumped on to the spider’s body and moved towards the head .  The spider thrashed about and tried to get him with its legs, but Jinwoo was not about to be caught by a blind attack . </p>
<p>slam! slam! slam! </p>
<p>Only the poor ground was turned into swiss cheese .  </p>
<p>On top of its head, Jinwoo repeatedly attacked the remaining eyes . </p>
<p>stab! stab! stab! </p>
<p>screeeech!</p>
<p>stab! stab!</p>
<p>screeeeeeeeech!</p>
<p>The spider shook its body side to side, but Jinwoo held on and continued put holes in the spider’s head .  It began to falter . The damage was being done . Jinwoo’s hands became faster . </p>
<p>. <strong>Eventually, the spider’s giant body finally slammed on to the ground . </strong>. </p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>But Jinwoo still kept going .  Until its life was snuffed out . </p>
<p>stab! stab! stab! </p>
<p>krrrrl-</p>
<p>With its death rattle, messages appeared . </p>

<p>He went from level 18 to 21 in a leap .  And that was not it . Another message accompanied the level-up messages . </p>

<p>‘I can finally use my gold . ’</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He had to leave before the Gate closed after all .  There would be plenty of time to take a look at the shop outside .  Halfway down the body, Jinwoo noticed a shiny light in the middle of the spider’s head . </p>
<p>‘Item?’</p>
<p>But compared to a monster’s drop, there was no item message, and he could not automatically obtain whatever it was . </p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Briefly thinking about it, Jinwoo quickly realized . </p>
<p>‘Ah, right .  Magic cores . ’</p>
<p>No matter how hurried he was, he couldn’t forget those .  He went to the spider’s head and ripped out the magic core .  Coming from the boss of a C-rank Dungeon, it was worth about 10 million won .  It was not a bad reward for the troublesome fight . </p>
<p>Jinwoo leaped down from the spider’s head .  After a light landing, he took a glance backwards and noticed another source of light from the spider’s abdomen .  And multiple of them, too!</p>
<p>Jinwoo became suspicious .  He had heard of magic beasts with extra magic cores, but this was too many . </p>
<p>‘What could it be?’</p>
<p>Cutting open the spider’s body, he found his answer .  The corpses of many half-eaten bug magic beasts fell out of the stomach .  The light was coming from each of the bugs . </p>
<p>“Maybe . ”</p>
<p>Going from bug to bug, he found a magic core in each of them .  Some of them were smaller due to being digested, but many more were in perfect condition .  Combined, he obtained 10 more magic cores . </p>
<p>“Awesome!”</p>
<p>He came here for rent money .  He would walk away with a mortgage . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>Turning around, he saw Yoo Jinho . </p>
<p>“Please, you can put them here . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho took the magic cores and placed them in his own pack with great care .  Then, he took out a thermos and poured something out in its cap . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim . You’re thirsty, right? Here’s some water . ”</p>
<p>The water was cold enough to collect condensation on the cup . </p>
<p>‘Why is he doing all this?’</p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “false ranker” (부정 등록자): Lit . “illegal/dishonest” 부정 + “registrant/a registered person” 등록자 .  Based on the context, I felt like a “false ranker” was a better fit . </p>
<p>[2]: “boss” (주인): The word used here actually does not mean boss at all .  주인 means “owner” or “master” . I substituted boss for context . </p>
<p>[3]: “gate” (던전의 입구): Again, word used here is not “gate”, but “Dungeon’s entrance” .  Context reasons to shorten the phrasing . </p>
