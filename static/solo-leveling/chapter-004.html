<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 4</p>
<p>-4 . The Three Commandments-</p>
<p>Jinwoo shouted towards the other Hunters . </p>
<p>“Everyone!”</p>
<p>They turned their heads toward his voice . </p>
<p>“You have to bow before the Statue of God!”</p>
<p>The Hunters tilted their heads in confusion . </p>
<p>“Bow…?”</p>
<p>“Bow to that thing?”</p>
<p>The Hunters who were looking at each other started cursing at Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“Fuck… What the hell are you saying?!”</p>
<p>“Is this a situation where you could say something like that?!”</p>
<p>“Have you gone crazy, Sung Jinwoo?!”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim flared his nostrils . </p>
<p>“Looks like I judged you wrong! If I could get up from this spot, I’d sock you right in the nose!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo bit his lips .  After all, 6 of their comrades had fallen to the Statue of God .  To think that he’d ask the others to bow before it understandably invited their ire . </p>
<p>‘More importantly…’</p>
<p>There was no solid proof to his guesses .  Only a gut feeling . One could not easily explain or put to words what they felt through instinct . </p>
<p>While he was lost for words, someone spoke up: “I’ll do it . ”</p>
<p>The voice came from behind Jinwoo .  The Hunters’ eyes turned toward the Raid leader who had spoken . </p>
<p>“Mr . Song…?”</p>
<p>“You’re going to bow before that goddamn statue?”</p>
<p>As the Hunters spoke out in confusion, Mr . Song turned and met Jinwoo’s eyes . </p>
<p>“What have you discovered?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo shook his head . </p>
<p>“Just a gut feeling?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, for now . ”</p>
<p>“I see . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s instincts resulted in 11 of them being still alive, well, 10 after Mr . Joo’s death .  As such, was it not worth it to try and put some faith in him? This was what Mr . Song believed .  As the Raid leader bowed before the Statue of God, the mood in the air became somber . </p>
<p>“You’re really going to do it?”</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity Mr . Song had provided, Jinwoo spoke up,</p>
<p>“Please! Bow before the Statue of God .  This might be our only way to leave here alive!”</p>
<p>Alive . </p>
<p>To leave here alive . </p>
<p>That phrase reached the others’ ears with a great weight . </p>
<p>‘Leave here alive?’</p>
<p>‘We can get out of here?’</p>
<p>‘Just by bowing before that thing?’</p>
<p>One by one, the hesitant Hunters started bowing before the Statue, imitating a scene of worship .  Eventually, even the angry Mr . Kim also took his place bowing before the Statue . However, there was no response from the Statue of God .  Its two eyes still glowed with the terrifying crimson light . Jinwoo felt his heart sinking to his stomach . </p>
<p>‘Was I wrong?’</p>
<p>And his gaze turned to Juhee at his side .  Lying completely prone on the ground with her hands covering her head, it was hard to say that she was in a position of bowing before the Statue . </p>
<p>‘Ah…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo gently grabbed Juhee’s wrists .  Startled, Juhee looked up at him like a terrified prey .  He wordlessly nodded at her, then released his hand . Slowly, Jinwoo helped Juhee assumed the position of worship before the Statue of God . </p>
<p>‘This should do it . ’</p>
<p>And then there was one .  Himself . </p>
<p>Jinwoo faced the Statue, kneeling, then put his hands on the ground and slowly bowed his head . </p>
<p>And a change occurred . </p>
<p>“Oh, ooh?”</p>
<p>The Hunters who noticed started making noise . </p>
<p>“The Statue of God? Everyone, look at the Statue of God!”</p>
<p>“Its eyes!”</p>
<p>The crimson light that adorned the Statue’s eyes were fading away . </p>
<p>“What? You mean this really is working?”</p>
<p>And just like that, the lights completely disappeared from the Statue’s eyes . </p>
<p>The Hunters cheered in unison . </p>
<p>“The light disappeared!”</p>
<p>“We’re alive!”</p>
<p>The excited Hunters rose from their spots and cheered, but the Statue of God did not react .  Jinwoo, who followed suit, sighed with relief . </p>
<p>“Phew-“</p>
<p>As he had guessed .  This room was operating accordingly to a set of rules and conditions, just like a game . </p>
<p>‘If that’s true,’</p>
<p>The game was not over yet .  There were two more Commandments . </p>
<p>Second: Praise the Lord; Third: Prove your Faith</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a deep rumbling, the entire room started to shake .  Jinwoo’s expression hardened . </p>
<p>‘As I thought…’</p>
<p>His guesses were correct .  This was not over . </p>
<p>The Statue of God’s enormous body was slowly rising from its seat . </p>
<p>“Eh, eh?!”</p>
<p>The Hunters who were celebrating together with tears of joy froze . </p>
<p>“W-what?! Wasn’t it all over?!”</p>
<p>“No, it can’t be!”</p>
<p>Frozen in fear, the Hunters could not say much more .  Their faces were filled with terror and despair . </p>
<p>“No… no…”</p>
<p>The Statue of God assumed a standing position .  It looked around, taking in the surrounding, then started walking towards the Hunters . </p>
<p> </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>With each step it took, the Statue of God shook the earth . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>Its massive figure was such that its head almost reached the ceiling . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>As its sheer size put pressure on the Hunters, it slowly closed the gap between it and them . </p>
<p>“Hey, Mr . Sung! Mr . Sung Jinwoo!”</p>
<p>“What should we do?!”</p>
<p>The Hunters who were cursing Jinwoo only moments ago now looked towards him for hope . </p>
<p>“Is there anything else we have to do?!”</p>
<p>“Say something!”</p>
<p>Even as grown adults, the Hunters’ faces were on the verge of breaking down in tears .  Yet they looked at Jinwoo as their only remaining hope . Jinwoo carefully helped Juhee, frozen in fear, to her feet, and he explained the Second Commandment . </p>
<p>“It said, ‘Praise the Lord’, that’s our clue . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s!” Mr . Kim spoke knowingly, “It was written on the tablet, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, ‘Praise the Lord’, ‘Prove your Faith’, we have to fulfill all three Commandments . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s words were filled with urgency . </p>
<p>BOOM~!</p>
<p>With one last step, the Statue of God had already arrived before their group .  Its massive shadows covered the Hunters, whose faces became pale . </p>
<p>“I, I’ll try . ”</p>
<p>One of the Hunters, normally a shy, youthful man, stepped forward . </p>
<p>“Hey! What are you going to try?!”</p>
<p>“I’m part of my church’s choir .  If it’s ‘praise’, I’m confident in it . ”</p>
<p>The young man answered Mr . Kim and walked towards the Statue of God .  As he neared the Statue, he took a deep breath and started singing,</p>
<p>“ ~As I walk to the Lord~ ” His youthful voice rang throughout the room . </p>
<p>“ ~Please renew me and provide me with your blessing . ~ ”</p>
<p>The Statue of God stopped before him . </p>
<p>The Hunters gasped in surprise and awe .  As if it was satisfied by the song, the Statue of God stood motionless .  All other sounds of the room disappeared, only the youth’s voice was heard in the room .  Gaining courage from the apparent result, the Hunter strengthened his voice and continued to sing,</p>
<p>“ ~All my weaknesses will be washed away by the grace of my Lord~ ”</p>
<p>Amidst the hopeful Hunters, Jinwoo could not shake the feeling of uneasiness .  The feeling that they were missing something . </p>
<p>‘No… this is all wrong . ’</p>
<p>He kept repeating the thought to himself .  This room had its own set of rules . Right now, the youthful Hunter was following the rule of Christianity, not this room .  But thankfully, the Statue of God was not moving . Maybe this was enough to satisfy the conditions?</p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head .  The reason why he had not stopped the singing was because he could not think of any other way to stop the Statue of God . </p>
<p>Suddenly,</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>A loud crash broke through the singing, followed by a scream,</p>
<p>“Kiyaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>As the Statue of God raised its foot again, the mangled remains of the singing Hunter fell from its sole . </p>
<p>The other Hunters started screaming as well . </p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“Uwaaaaak!”</p>
<p>The previously emotionless face of the Statue of God was now filled with an incredible rage . </p>
<p>“It’s angry!”</p>
<p>“R-run!”</p>
<p>The Hunters quickly ran away from the Statue . </p>
<p>“Kiyaaaaah!!!”</p>
<p>Having lost all thought and reason after seeing the youthful man be crushed beneath the Statue of God’s foot, a female Hunter simply stood in place and screamed . </p>
<p>‘Shit…!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo, who was running with Juhee in his arms, quickly turned to try and help her .  But he was blocked by Mr . Song . </p>
<p>“Ahjussi…?”</p>
<p>“It’s too late!”</p>
<p>Like swatting a fly, the Statue of God slammed its hand on top of the female Hunter . </p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned away .  It was a gruesome scene which he could not bear to witness . </p>
<p>“We can’t dilly dally here!  Are you trying to get that young lady killed as well?!”</p>
<p>At Mr . Song’s rebuke, Jinwoo snapped back to attention .  Mr . Song was right . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>“Uwaaaak!”</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>“Help me!”</p>
<p>No longer walking, the Statue of God ran from Hunter to Hunter, crushing them beneath his feet .  With each step, he shook the entire temple . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>Jinwoo ran with his teeth clenched .  With her eyes closed, Juhee held on to Jinwoo as they ran . </p>
<p>“Let’s split apart!”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>Knowing that running together made them a better target, Jinwoo and Mr . Song separated away from each other .  Trying to maintain the largest distance between himself and the Statue of God, Jinwoo ran towards a spot at the walls .  He saw that Mr . Park was already there, having ran with all his might, knowing there was more on the line to him than just his own life .  The image of his family reflected over his teary eyes . </p>
<p>His son, who looked just like his father .  His wife, with his second child . Mr . Park could not afford to die in a place like this .  Pulling forth every ounce of his strength, Mr . Park was able to reach the walls faster than the other Hunters . </p>
<p>“Huff… Huff…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mr . Kim, who was friends with the man, shouted at the panting Mr . Park . </p>
<p>“Mr . Park!”</p>
<p>At the familiar voice, Mr . Park turned towards Mr . Kim,</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim gestured towards Mr . Park’s back and yelled,</p>
<p>“Turn! Turn around!”</p>
<p>And something sharp flashed from behind Mr . Park . </p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>slash- </p>
<p>Mr . Park was split cleanly from the top of his head to the base of his crotch .  The evenly separated sides of his body fell in different directions on to the ground . </p>
<p>“MR . PARK!!!”</p>
<p>The statue that had cleaved Mr . Park in twain with its sword simply returned and assumed its position on the walls, as if nothing had happened . </p>
<p>Mr . Kim held back tears as he witnessed the death of his friend . </p>
<p>“These fucking pieces of-!”</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>Behind him, the giant Statue of God was going from Hunter to Hunter, crushing them with his feet .  Those that fled to the walls were attacked by the statues . </p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“My arm! My arm!”</p>
<p>The interior of the temple had turned into a scene of terror and carnage . </p>
<p>Jinwoo panted wildly as he ran, his forehead dripping with cold sweat .  His legs getting heavier and heavier; his breath getting shallower and shallower .  But his head was filled with a single thought, repeated over and over again:</p>
<p>‘Praise the Lord .  Praise the Lord . Praise the Lord . ’</p>
<p>The Second Commandment that swam through his head .  The key to solving the meaning of the Commandments must be hidden in this room . </p>
<p>‘There must be something in here that we’re supposed to use!’</p>
<p>But when the Hunters initially entered the temple and looked around, they found no tools or mechanisms . </p>
<p>‘The only thing here are those damned statues . ’</p>
<p>‘Wait . ’</p>
<p>A thought appeared in Jinwoo’s head . </p>
<p>‘The only thing that’s here are those statues?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>“Why didn’t I think of that?!”</p>
<p>If the statues were the only thing in this room .  Then the statues must be the key to solving the mystery .  The statues only moved when someone entered their proximity; this must have been the key to using them somehow . </p>
<p>‘If that’s correct…!’</p>
<p>Gathering what energy he had left, Jinwoo screamed through his panting breath,</p>
<p>“EVERYONE, HEAD TO THE STATUES WITH INSTRUMENTS!”</p>
