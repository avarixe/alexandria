<h3>Chapter 190: Chapter 190</h3> <p>The TV in the living room was showing the scenes of yet another accident that took place within a dungeon . Those seemed to happen frequently nowadays </p>
<p>Although no events that could be called truly enormous happened so far, the number of Hunters dying during the raids was on the rise lately, according to the news broadcast </p>
<p>“I wonder, will my boy be okay?”. </p>
<p>His mother, watching the news, recalled Jin-Woo and whispered to herself in a worried voice </p>
<p>Didn’t matter how excellent a Hunter her son was, there was no helping with a mother worrying about her child’s safety </p>
<p>Beru, hiding within the shadows to protect this home as per Jin-Woo’s instruction, heard her whispers </p>
<p>‘Oh, the mother of my king . If my liege meets with an accident that even he can’t survive, then no one in this world can . ’. </p>
<p>Beru did his best to suppress the words trying to jump out of his mouth . Obviously, he couldn’t surprise the mother of his liege needlessly, now could he? As his reward, he’d have to suffer in silent frustration all by himself </p>
<p>He also found the liege’s mother, currently equating his liege against those low-class monsters shown on the TV screen, rather cruel and unkind for doing that . However, he roused up a super-human level of endurance and suppressed his desire to preach the incomparable might of his dear liege to her </p>
<p>[Next up . We bring you the news on the conference organised by America’s Hunter Bureau… . ]. </p>
<p>The scene shown on TV changed yet again to that of a certain American airport as the news related to the International Guild Conference played out . And then, Jin-Woo appeared on the screen as he stepped foot into the airport </p>
<p>She saw her son walking forward as he was swarmed by the constant explosions of camera flashes . The worried look on her face was soon replaced by a contented smile </p>
<p>“Jin-Ah? Your brother’s on TV . ”. </p>
<p>“Really?”. </p>
<p>Jin-Ah abandoned her studies and quickly trotted out of her room . This wouldn’t be the first time, but regardless, seeing her oppa on the TV screen remained a mystifying and welcoming viewing experience to her, even now </p>
<p>But the thing was – both Jin-Ah and her mom had no idea </p>
<p>They simply had no idea that there was someone very close, cheering on even more passionately then they did while watching the TV screen </p>
<p>‘Oh, my king… . !’. </p>
<p>Beru’s deeply-moved eyes were firmly fixed on the screen as he watched the clip being played out </p>
<p>But then, a powerful chill began invading his body out of the blue . Literally, without warning, his body hidden in the shadows began trembling non-stop </p>
<p>This sensation, hadn’t he felt something similar to this in the past?. </p>
<p>When was that?. </p>
<p>Beru combed through his memories and finally recalled that moment . Back then, right when the king’s gaze filled with killing intent was looking down on him . It was at that moment </p>
<p>A feeling of death that could not be avoided . The warning bells rang out loudly via his instincts after detecting the unmistakable stench of death </p>
<p>The king’s rage he felt for the first time since becoming his Shadow Soldier was so great that Beru’s entire thought process froze up . However, he was still his king’s loyal soldier!. </p>
<p>He regained his wits quite quickly </p>
<p>‘… . My king has been truly enraged . ’. </p>
<p>Now that he realised something had happened to his king, he couldn’t just sit around quivering in fear like this . Beru quickly sent a signal to Jin-Woo and tried to engage him conversation </p>
<p>‘Oh, my king . Please compose yourself . I shall get to your side immediately . ’. </p>
<p>The response arrived immediately </p>
<p>[You… . Don’t make a move . ]. </p>
<p>Beru heard the king’s voice which sounded like unchecked rage being compressed into a volatile mass . He could only tremble like a leaf against stormy winds </p>
<p>‘I shall obey . ’. </p>
<p>He could only say that he’d submit to the command, that was all . But at the same time, he became also curious about the moron who managed to earn his king’s wrath </p>
<p>‘Why would anyone do something so reckless and ill-advised… . ’. </p>
<p>To numb the fear, even if only by a little, Beru hid his still-trembling body ever deeper into the shadow </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>In the city of Busan </p>
<p>The Knight Order Guild was in the middle of preparing for a raid </p>
<p>The Master of the Guild, Park Jong-Su, was confirming the raid party members and their current conditions one last time, as the will to make this raid a success burned fiercely within his heart </p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of accidents happening in dungeons lately . So, everyone – keep your wits about you at all times! Let’s make sure that not a single person gets injured today!”. </p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”. </p>
<p>The Guild members had become rather docile after experiencing a raid together with Jin-Woo’s summoned creatures . And now, they even sounded properly disciplined, as well </p>
<p>It was at that moment something strange happened </p>
<p>The Vice-Master of the Guild, Jeong Yun-Tae, was standing behind Park Jong-Su to nod his head and provide suitable reactions to his boss’s words . But, he discovered something and his eyes nearly popped out of his sockets </p>
<p>“Heok?!”. </p>
<p>Park Jong-Su hurriedly looked behind him </p>
<p>“What?! What happened?”. </p>
<p>Jeong Yun-Tae pointed to the ground and alternated his gaze between Park Jong-Su and the shadow beneath his boss’s feet </p>
<p>“H-hyung-nim!! Your, your shadow! The shadow on the ground was vibrating… . ”. </p>
<p>Jeong Yun-Tae discovered that Park Jong-Su was glaring at him with narrowed eyes and stopped talking right there and then </p>
<p>“Hey, Yun-Tae? How many times have I told you not to touch booze before a raid?”. </p>
<p>“N-no, hyung-nim! I haven’t had a drop of the stuff today! But your shadow, it really did vibrate! Like it was alive!”. </p>
<p>Park Jong-Su stared at Jeong Yun-Tae with criticising eyes and spat out a long groan </p>
<p>“This won’t do . Take a day off today . ”. </p>
<p>“Hyung-nim! I’m telling you the truth!”. </p>
<p>“Okay, everyone! Time to go inside . The Knight Order Guild, let’s do our best today, too! Fighting!”. </p>
<p>“Ahh! B-but, hyung-nim…!”. </p>
<p>Just as Jeong Yun-Tae’s voice that protested his innocence resounded in the air…. </p>
<p>Unbelievable sightings of shadows trembling streamed in from all the spots where Jin-Woo had left behind his Shadow Soldiers . Shadows trembled noticeably as if they didn’t care for the presence of witnesses or not </p>
<p>But then again, the Shadow Soldiers had no choice but to shiver from the emotion of pure rage their lord was feeling at that moment </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>– Exchange </p>
<p>The High Orc soldier disappeared, only to be replaced by Jin-Woo </p>
<p>‘… . !!’. </p>
<p>Hwang Dong-Su’s group froze up like a mouse confronted by a snake the moment this unexpected intruder entered the stage completely unannounced . Especially for Hwang Dong-Su himself, he nearly even forgot to breathe after recognising Jin-Woo’s face </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jin-Woo simply strode past the stunned rank S Hunter, as if the latter didn’t even exist, and stopped before Yu Jin-Ho . No one said anything, yet the two Americans standing near the unconscious kid quickly stepped back at the same time, as if they agreed to do so beforehand </p>
<p>After summoning out a healing potion, Jin-Woo began easing a little bit of liquid down into Yu Jin-Ho’s mouth </p>
<p>Unfortunately…. </p>
<p>[When the remaining HP is less than 10%, it is impossible to recover HP with healing potions . ]. </p>
<p>… . The message saying it was impossible to heal the kid’s wounds popped up in his view along with the familiar ‘Tti-ring’ </p>
<p>Crack </p>
<p>The empty vial of healing potion shattered in Jin-Woo’s hand </p>
<p>The ‘Divine Water of Life’ was meant to heal diseases and illnesses . It couldn’t help in matters of physical injuries like this . It was the same principle of healing magic not being able to cure illnesses </p>
<p>‘I need healing magic . ’. </p>
<p>Too bad, the only Shadow Soldier capable of using healing magic, Beru, was currently back in Korea house-sitting . Even if Jin-Woo recalled him now, who knows just how long he’d take to get here…. </p>
<p>… . It was around this time that Hwang Dong-Su finally regained his wits and tried to engage Jin-Woo in conversation </p>
<p>“You… You, what the hell? That Orc, just now… What the hell did you do?”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn’t respond to that and simply asked the two men before him, instead </p>
<p>“Is either one of you a Healer?”. </p>
<p>Hearing the word ‘Healer’, the Healer-type Hunter ended up reflexively nodding his head . Jin-Woo pointed to Yu Jin-Ho </p>
<p>“Heal him . Now . ”. </p>
<p>The Healer’s gaze shifted over to Hwang Dong-Su . The latter shook his head . Jin-Woo carefully lowered Yu Jin-Ho’s upper torso back down and stood up </p>
<p>“Final warning . Heal him . ”. </p>
<p>The Healer’s gaze shifted back to Hwang Dong-Su again, but the answer remained the same . So, the Healer stared straight at Jin-Woo and the corners of his lips arched up </p>
<p>“You see, dude, you should talk to the boss first before…”. </p>
<p>He didn’t get to finish his sentence </p>
<p>Ka-boom!!. </p>
<p>Just like how Hwang Dong-Su had done to Yu Jin-Ho, Jin-Woo slammed the Healer’s head on the ground . It happened so fast that no one saw his movements </p>
<p>Hwang Dong-Su might have been a rank S himself, but he simply failed to even sense Jin-Woo’s attack and only belatedly discovered the Healer lying face down on the ground </p>
<p>Jin-Woo shifted his gaze to the second of the Americans </p>
<p>“Are you a Healer?”. </p>
<p>This man finally confirmed the face of Jin-Woo walking closer to him and his jaw began trembling in shock </p>
<p>“S-Seong Jin-Woo?! Hunter Seong Jin-Woo??”. </p>
<p>He back-pedalled in panic and began glaring at Hwang Dong-Su before shouting out </p>
<p>“Mister Hwang Dong-Su! You promised that this matter had nothing to do with Seong Jin-Woo! What the f*ck is this?! Ah?? What is this sh*t?!”. </p>
<p>“I asked you if you are a Healer or not . ”. </p>
<p>“N-no, I, I’m not . I’m just… . ”. </p>
<p>His answer was also abruptly cut off there </p>
<p>Ka-boom!. </p>
<p>Struck by an unseen hand, the man’s head crashed to the ground like his friend’s before him . In the blink of an eye, two high-ranked Hunters had lost their consciousness </p>
<p>Finally getting to witness Jin-Woo’s real strength with his own two eyes, Hwang Dong-Su felt his heart pounding away like crazy </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>“H-hyung-nim…”. </p>
<p>Perhaps because the ground rumbled loudly twice in a row? Yu Jin-Ho had regained his consciousness somehow </p>
<p>“Hyung… . nim… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo lowered his body and listened closely to the kid’s voice </p>
<p>“Hey, Jin-Ho . I’m here . ”. </p>
<p>Yu Jin-Ho managed to crack open his swollen eyelids . He barely managed to move the muscles on his bloodied and messed-up face, his words clearly being formed with great difficulty </p>
<p>“Hwang Dong-Su… little brother… Hwang Dong-Seok… . Be careful…”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo looked at Yu Jin-Ho breathing weakly with a helpless expression before stopping the kid’s words </p>
<p>“Shh . It’s fine . Don’t speak anymore . ”. </p>
<p>“Hyung-nim… . ”. </p>
<p>Yu Jin-Ho grabbed Jin-Woo’s hand as tears pooled on the edges of his eyes </p>
<p>Jin-Woo quietly asked </p>
<p>“Can you hold on for a little longer?”. </p>
<p>Nod, nod </p>
<p>It became harder to speak so Yu Jin-Ho made do with a nod to answer the question </p>
<p>Jin-Woo carefully let go of his dongsaeng’s hand and slowly got back up to his feet, before shifting his gaze back over to Hwang Dong-Su </p>
<p>However, Hwang Dong-Su didn’t back down and shot a glare right back . His legs were weakly trembling from the pressure of Jin-Woo’s murderous eyes, but he was not someone who’d cower and run away </p>
<p>In the meantime, Jin-Woo’s coldly-flickering eyes were getting closer and closer . Hwang Dong-Su did his best to look unruffled and raised his voice </p>
<p>“It was you, wasn’t it? You killed my older brother, Hwang Dong-Seok . Am I right?”. </p>
<p>Hwang Dong-Su’s scared face grew closer with every step taken . And then, a certain someone’s face who enjoyed being strong against the weak, but remained weak against someone stronger, overlapped with his face in Jin-Woo’s view </p>
<p>That caused his glare to become even colder </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hwang Dong-Su cried out </p>
<p>“Answer me!! Seong Jin-Woo, didn’t you murder my brother and his team?!”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo stopped right in front of Hwang Dong-Su’s nose and replied </p>
<p>“Ask him after you meet him again . ”. </p>
<p>Grit </p>
<p>Hwang Dong-Su punched with his fist wrapped in bright light . He was aiming for Jin-Woo’s face . Unfortunately for him, the latter simply ducked lower to evade that and shoved his own fist deep into the former’s stomach </p>
<p>“Keo-Heok!”. </p>
<p>Just one hit and Hwang Dong-Su vomited out a mouthful of blood </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>“Stop the car!”. </p>
<p>“Sir?”. </p>
<p>“I said, stop the d*mn car!”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre roared out and the car he was riding in came to a sudden halt . As the vehicle in front carrying their Guild Master came to an abrupt halt, the chasing cars ferrying the Guild members all hurriedly came to a stop as well </p>
<p>Screech, screeech… </p>
<p>Loud noises resounded out from everywhere . Completely disregarding that…. </p>
<p>Boom!. </p>
<p>… . Thomas Andre kicked the car’s door away and climbed out in a hurry so he could glare in a certain direction . His expression crumpled into a vicious scowl </p>
<p>“D*mn it… . ”. </p>
<p>The elites of the Scavenger Guild, often referred to as the world’s best, jumped out from all the halted vehicles </p>
<p>“Master, what is it?”. </p>
<p>“Did something happen?”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre answered briefly to all the hurried questions from the Guild members </p>
<p>“It has already begun . I’ll go ahead, so hurry and follow after me . ”. </p>
<p>“Sir??”. </p>
<p>What had already begun?. </p>
<p>Before anyone could ask him for an explanation, though, Thomas Andre bent his knees . The muscles on his legs expanded powerfully and the asphalt on the ground began melting down . Other Hunters naturally took two, three steps away from him </p>
<p>Ka-boom!!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre exploded up from the ground and in an instant, disappeared from their view </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>‘Something is… . coming . ’. </p>
<p>Something strong, that was </p>
<p>Just as Thomas Andre had sensed Jin-Woo’s powers, the latter also sensed the former’s presence . So, he stopped moving his punching hand </p>
<p>His other hand was still grabbing onto the collar of Hwang Dong-Su, who now was suffering from just as many grievous wounds as Yu Jin-Ho </p>
<p>Ka-boom!. </p>
<p>A part of the disused factory’s ceiling caved in and through the open gap, one of the four remaining Special Authority-rank Hunters in the world, Thomas Andre, flew in and landed on the ground </p>
<p>Since he knew that a guest was arriving anyway, Jin-Woo wasn’t surprised in the slightest as he calmly took a look at the landing zone </p>
<p>Thomas Andre stood up straight and quickly confirmed the situation </p>
<p>He first saw Yu Jin-Ho, then Jin-Woo, and finally, the end of Jin-Woo’s hand . His gaze moved in that order, until stopping at Hwang Dong-Su </p>
<p>Right away, Thomas Andre’s forehead creased up . Jin-Woo’s incredible magical energy emission had completely masked Hwang Dong-Su’s presence and he couldn’t initially sense it </p>
<p>Thomas Andre took off and discarded his sunglasses </p>
<p>“Hwang Dong-Su… Is he still alive?”. </p>
<p>“For now . ”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre resorted to using simple English and enunciated each word loudly so that Jin-Woo, someone who might be not familiar with the language, could hear him clearly </p>
<p>“Let him go . If you do that, we’ll forget that today’s event had ever happened . I’m asking you for a favour . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo strengthened his grip on Hwang Dong-Su’s collar and asked </p>
<p>“What if I don’t want to?”. </p>
<p>“Then, well . A favour won’t be a favour anymore . ”. </p>
<p>One of the most powerful Hunters in the world bared his fangs </p>
<p>A regular Hunter would start p*ssing their pants right about now . However, Jin-Woo’s own aura didn’t lose out to Thomas Andre’s </p>
<p>“Come, then . ”. </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 190 &gt; Fin </p>
