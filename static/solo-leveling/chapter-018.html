<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 18</p>
<p>Having finished his preparation in a minute, Jinwoo called for a cab and arrived at the promised location . </p>
<p>9 people were waiting for him .  A man who appeared to be their leader waved to Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Over here!”</p>
<p>It was a rather hairy man with a large body .  He greeted Jinwoo with a smile,</p>
<p>“Sung Jinwoo-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Yeah . ”</p>
<p>“Alright, glad you made it .  Shall we introduce ourselves?”</p>
<p>The man briefly introduced his teammates .  Eight of the Hunters, including himself, were a group that had been working together for a long time .  The ninth Hunter, like Jinwoo, came after seeing the job post to fill the headcount . </p>
<p>As he greeted his teammates, Jinwoo looked over their faces .  Due to his raised sense stat, he was able to discern the relative strength between the gathered Hunters . </p>
<p>‘Five of them are about the same level .  Four of them below . So it’s five C-ranks and four D-ranks?’</p>
<p>Raiding a C-rank Gate had rules .  It required a minimum of 10 people, and half of the party had to be at least C-rank .  Only then, the Association would give raiding permission . It seemed like their need for Jinwoo just to the fill the headcount was true . </p>
<p>“Now that we’ve all been introduced, I’ll explain a few things . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok, a C-rank Hunter, had a relaxed face born from experience .  As he began to explain the various rules and warnings in this Raid, someone approached Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“So- looks like we’re both tagalongs . ”</p>
<p>The young man with a bright face was the other Hunter recruited by Hwang Dongseok to fill the headcount .  However, unlike Jinwoo, he was not a noncombatant; he was a D-ranker who would be participating in battle . </p>
<p>His name was Yoo Jinho, 22 years old .  Jinwoo greeted him with a light bow of his head and turned back to Hwang Dongseok .  Yoo Jinho, who had hoped for a conversation, scratched his head and returned to his spot . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim[1], let’s just go in already . ”</p>
<p>“It’s just going to be us fighting anyways, so why explain all that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I suppose it’s all falling on deaf ears . ”</p>
<p>As his team members complained, Hwang Dongseok laughed and clapped his hands . </p>
<p>“Alright then, I’ll stop the explanations here .  Let’s head on in . ”</p>
<p>Everyone began the last minute preparation before heading to the Gate . </p>
<p>“Ah, before that, if you two could just sign this real quick . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok handed Jinwoo and Yoo Jinho a piece of paper .  It was a simple contract . </p>
<p>“You just have to write your name at the end and sign . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s contract stated that he would not be involved in combat or be given part of the loot .  Instead, he would receive 2 million won at the end of the Raid . It was same as the conversation Jinwoo had over the phone .  However, a line at the end caught Jinwoo’s eye,</p>
<p>‘No matter what accident befalls in the Dungeon, they would not take any responsibility…’</p>
<p>Compared to an official Raid under the Association, a private Raid had no compensation if something happened .  Hunters could not even obtain insurance; their lives involved too much danger . </p>
<p>Reading the line, it officially hit Jinwoo that he had entered a raiding party . </p>
<p>Before signing, Jinwoo asked Hwang Dongseok,</p>
<p>“So what do you need me to do?”</p>
<p>“Not much, just follow us around and carry the baggage . ”</p>
<p>“Baggage…?”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok gestured to a large backpack his teammates were unloading from a Bongo[2] .  </p>
<p>“Inside it are food, clothes, equipment, first aid kit, etc…”</p>
<p>Wait, a first aid kit in a Dungeon?</p>
<p>“Are we going in without a Healer?”</p>
<p>“You should know, it’s really hard to get a Healer-class Hunter for a personal raiding party .  We’ve always been like this”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok laughed awkwardly .  </p>
<p>A raiding party formed at the last minute, only going in with the minimum headcount . </p>
<p>A filler member who mistook the Raid for a social gathering . </p>
<p>And now, the news that there were no Healers in the party, only Tankers and Dealers . </p>
<p>Jinwoo swallowed his laugh,</p>
<p>‘They’re all scrubs . ’</p>
<p>Still, the reason he was able to sign the contract was not because of the 2 million won .  It was because he was confident in his abilities to protect himself . </p>
<p>“Here you go . ”</p>
<p>. <strong>“Mine as well!”</strong>. </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok checked the two men’s signatures then proclaimed loudly,</p>
<p>“Then, let’s go!”</p>
<p>The party headed towards the place the Gate had appeared .  It was an abandoned construction site for an apartment complex .  The construction had been halted partway . </p>
<p>“Tsk . I suppose the economy’s not doing that well . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok clicked his tongue .  The traces of the unfinished building stood like a gravestone .  It would be a fitting memorial to a giant . </p>
<p>“Did you know?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho walked up to Jinwoo’s side and spoke in a lowered voice,</p>
<p>“I heard the investors and the employees who worked here lost everything and are struggling to live these days .  But the president of the company ran away from the country with 900 billion won two months ago . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Although Jinwoo gave repeated indication that he did not want to talk, Yoo Jinho did not appear to want to leave Jinwoo’s side .  This might’ve been because the 8 people that excluded the two appeared to be old friends, and it was hard to fit amongst them . </p>
<p>“Hyung, are you usually a man of few words?”</p>
<p>Before he realized it, Jinho was calling him hyung .  Even ignoring him was becoming tiring . </p>
<p>“ . You’re really bad at taking a hint . ”</p>
<p>“I grew up without having to, haha”</p>
<p>Jinwoo wasn’t sure if the boy was just optimistic or stupid .  He scratched his head at Yoo Jinho’s smiling face . </p>
<p>‘Hmm . I am tense, however . ’</p>
<p>It was true that he would become more stiff near Gates .  He couldn’t help it after all . To other Hunters, it may have been a simple source of income .  To Jinwoo, every Raid had been a battle for his life . All those painful memories were the cause of his stiffness . </p>
<p>“Over here,”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok stopped the party . </p>
<p>Oooh-</p>
<p>The Hunters gasped in awe . </p>
<p>“Hwang hyung, are you sure this is a C-rank Gate? It’s a little big . ”</p>
<p>“Psh, do you think the Association would lie? I heard their surveillance team already checked it out twice . ”</p>
<p>A black hole like entrance that hung in the air, that was the Gate .  </p>
<p>Waves of magic power would seep from the Gate, and the amount of magic power in those waves would determine the rank of the Gate .  Once discovered, the Association would send special teams that would measure the magic power with a device . The resulting information would be made public, and individuals or Guilds would request the raiding rights from the Association .  </p>
<p>Most of the B-rank and A-rank Gates would be picked up by large Guilds .  Those were too dangerous for an individual to lead a private party into . Instead, private parties would request and reserve C-rank or lower Gates . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok stopped before the Gate and turned to his party . </p>
<p>“I’ll go in first, please follow after . ”</p>
<p>The Tanker took the vanguard, then one by one, rest of the party followed . </p>
<p>‘Just in case . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo lightly stretched his body .  Next to him, Yoo Jinho was taking out various equipment from his bag .  The sword and shield he wielded sparked with radiance . Even at a glance, they were high quality equipment .  It was not something a beginner Hunter would be wielding . </p>
<p>‘Hmm… “grew up without having to take a hint” . Looks like he’s from a wealthy household . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked at Jinho with surprise .  Feeling his gaze, Jinho took few steps forward in elation . </p>
<p>. <strong>“Hyung, you said you were E-rank, right? I’ll make sure to protect you . Please stand close to me . ”</strong>. </p>
<p>Jinwoo scratched the back of his head .  Who was going to protect who? . </p>
<p>“ . Sure, thank you for that . ”</p>
<p>“Let’s go in as well . ”</p>
<p>Regardless of how Jinwoo felt, the two men safely entered the Gate . </p>
<p></p>
<p>The inside of the Dungeon was quiet . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>It was silent and dark . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok gave his first command . </p>
<p>“Gyuhwan, make a light . ”</p>
<p>“Yessir . ”</p>
<p>The Mage-class Hunter Jo Gyuhwan created a floating light .  Their surroundings became lit . Hwang Dongseok lowered his shield and tilted his head . </p>
<p>“What? Where are the magic beasts?”</p>
<p>“I wonder . There’s no light, either . ”</p>
<p>Normally in Dungeons, glowing rocks[3] would be placed here and there throughout the cave to light the way .  But this Dungeon did not appear to have any . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho whispered to Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“Hyung, are there any Dungeons with no magic beasts?”</p>
<p>“Shh . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo put a finger to his lips, his ears perked .  From a distance, he heard numerous footsteps approaching . </p>
<p>Jinwoo spoke,</p>
<p>“It’s not that there aren’t any . They just haven’t come yet . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho gulped . </p>
<p>skitter-</p>
<p>The party soon heard the noise that Jinwoo heard .  Hwang Dongseok felt something was off . </p>
<p>‘A Dungeon with no glowing rocks…?’</p>
<p>“What lives and moves in the dark and are attracted to the light?”</p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok and his teammates’ expressions darkened as one . </p>
<p>“Bugs!”</p>
<p>“It’s bugs!”</p>
<p>“Fuck, why of all the things, bugs?!”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok shouted at the party,</p>
<p>“Everyone, to your positions! They’re coming! Faces forward!”</p>
<p>Somewhere ahead of the tunnel, numerous “somethings” were heading this way . </p>
<p>“This isn’t an ant’s nest, is it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say something like that . ”</p>
<p>Of the many types of magic beasts, insect types were particularly troublesome .  They were hard to kill; they moved in groups; on top of that, even a single one of them had good amount of power .  And of the insect types, the worst were the ants . Many Hunters mistakenly entered the nest of ant magic beasts and met tragic ends . </p>
<p>skitter skitter skitter-</p>
<p>The sound of bugs moving across the floor became louder and louder .  They were nearing the party . Hwang Dongseok raised his shield below his chins .  But the insects did not appear . His juniors muttered from behind him,</p>
<p>“What? Where are they?”</p>
<p>“I can still hear them . ”</p>
<p>“Dongseok hyung, do you see anything?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo interrupted them,</p>
<p>“Above!”</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok reflexively looked up . </p>
<p>skitter skitter-</p>
<p>Giant bugs were coming at them across the ceiling .  If the warning had been a little late, the bugs would be falling on their heads now .  Against the magic beasts that clumped up on the ground like insects, losing your balance spelled a death sentence .  </p>
<p>‘If we had discovered them just a little later…’</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok’s insides squirmed .  Thankfully, he did not see any ants among the attacking bugs .  He gathered strength in his throat,</p>
<p>“Shoot! Shoot them down! I’ll grab the aggro[4] when they fall!”</p>
<p>Arrows and magic flew across the air towards the bugs . </p>
<p>woosh- thwack!</p>
<p>bang!</p>
<p>screeeeech!</p>
<p>scree-</p>
<p>As few of the bugs fell down due to the Hunters’ attacks, the remaining ones jumped to the ground of their own volition .  Their intent was to fight the Hunters . Now would begin the Tanker’s role in the fight . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok used a taunting skill and grabbed the attention of the magic beasts .  As if ensnared by some promise, all of them turned their gazes toward Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>“Over here, you insects!”</p>
<p>screeeech!</p>
<p>Dozens of magic beasts charged toward Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>crash!</p>
<p>clang! clang!</p>
<p>His shield blocked every one of their attacks .  Even with their strong claws and mandibles, the bugs were not able to get through the shield  The Tanker Hwang Dongseok skillfully held off the bugs . </p>
<p>“Hold .  Hold . Hold!”</p>
<p>He was waiting for the right time . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Hyung-nim”: Combination of “hyung” and honorific “nim” .  “Hyung” is the way younger male would address his older brother .  But it’s also used in general population (by younger male to and older male of a closer age) .  “Nim” is added as an honorific, denoting respect . </p>
<p>[2]: “Bongo” .  A small flatbed pickup truck . </p>
<p>[3]: “glowing rocks” (야광석): “darkness” 야 + “light” 광 + stone “석” .  “Light that glows in the dark” &gt; just “glowing rock” . The word “야광” also specially refers to the glow-in-the dark stuff . </p>
<p>[4]: “aggro” (어글): The author’s usage of gaming terminology is becoming more and more apparent .  Short for korean pronunciation of the english word “aggression”, it refers to the idea that a video game enemy will be focused on a target with the most threat .  Normally, that would be the damage dealers, but tanking roles often have special skills to forcibly increase their threat and draw the aggression or “aggro” of an enemy . </p>
