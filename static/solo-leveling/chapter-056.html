<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 56</p>
<p>After Jinwoo finished the errand to check his account balance, he went and got fitted for a suit and even had the time to get a haircut at a nearby salon . </p>
<p>“Hmm . ”</p>
<p>He was a completely different person than when he had left the house . </p>
<p>‘Money really is good . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stopped next to a shop window and checked his new look out in the reflection .  This should be good enough . </p>
<p>‘At the very least, I won’t leave a bad impression . ’</p>
<p>He checked the time .  It was 4:20 . </p>
<p>‘She said be there by 5 . ’</p>
<p>He would make it in time . </p>
<p>“Taxi!”</p>
<p>He hailed a cab and arrived at the school with time to spare .  He saw Jinah waiting for him out in front . </p>
<p>“Sung Jinah . ”</p>
<p>His little sister did not realize he had approached and jumped . </p>
<p>“Oppa?”</p>
<p>Jinah stared at him like a deer in headlights . </p>
<p>“Excuse me, are you really Sung Jinwoo-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Do you not recognize your own oppa?”</p>
<p>Jinah looked up and down on his figure and exclaimed,</p>
<p>“Well, you’re a completely different person!”</p>
<p>“Did you think I would meet my dongsaeng’s teacher in tracksuit and slippers?”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Jinah could not close her mouth . </p>
<p>“Your jaw’s going to fall off . I’m going ahead . ”</p>
<p>It looked like Jinah was too shocked to guide him, so Jinwoo took the lead .  He was a student here 5 years ago . The structure was familiar to him . He knew the meeting would happen in a conference room and not her homeroom, so he headed in that direction .  His pace was quick . </p>
<p>“O-oppa! Wait for me!”</p>
<p>Jinah quickly trotted after her brother . </p>
<p>“Hello, teacher . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, hello . ”</p>
<p>On the way, he greeted various teachers .  Everyone of them stared at him as he walked by . </p>
<p>‘Who was that?’</p>
<p>‘Is he an alumni? I don’t think there are students like that at our school . ’</p>
<p>‘Is he a new teacher?’</p>
<p>The teachers weren’t the only ones who turned their heads . </p>
<p>“Whoa, handsome . ”</p>
<p>“Who is that?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Jinah next to him?”</p>
<p>“It must be her brother . Wow, he’s so cool . ”</p>
<p>A muscular body and a fashionable suit .  Even a plain-looking person would catch their eyes .  Well, Jinwoo was completely uninterested . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>The student’s whispers went in one ear and out the other to him .  The one who was excited was Jinah . She perked her ears and listened to her fellow students’ whispers, then went up to her brother and ribbed him with her elbow . </p>
<p>“Wow, Oppa’s pretty popular~”</p>
<p>He ignored her the first time . </p>
<p>“You know, oppa doesn’t have a girlfriend, right?”</p>
<p>He ignored her the second time </p>
<p>“Should your cute little sister introduce you to someone?”</p>
<p>He pinched her cheeks the third time . </p>
<p>“Don’t mess around . ”</p>
<p>“S-sorry . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo released her, and she rubbed her red cheek . </p>
<p>“Che, I know you’re enjoying all this…”</p>
<p>While they were being siblings, they had arrived .  Jinah spun with a flourish then gestured . </p>
<p>“Oppa, it’s here . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was about to enter, then turned to Jinah . </p>
<p>“What about you?”</p>
<p>“This is only for the parent/guardian and the teacher . I’m just here to see you off . ”</p>
<p>Oh right, Jinwoo remembered his own back in his last year of highschool .  At the time, no one had come for him . </p>
<p>‘Mother was already having difficulties moving back then . ’</p>
<p>After she fell ill, his mother had to be quickly hospitalized .  Not wanting to exert her weak body, Jinwoo did not tell her about the parent/guardian meeting .  He had to endure the pestering of his teacher for a while because of that . Remembering that experience, he realized why Jinah was nervous when she asked for his time .  He asked his sister with a smile,</p>
<p>“You’re staying out late today, too, right?”</p>
<p>“Yep, you can go home without me . ”</p>
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>He patted her head before she could react, messing up her hair . </p>
<p>“Study hard . ”</p>
<p>“Ah danggit, don’t do that . ”</p>
<p>“I’ll see you at home . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo entered the conference room with a smile .  Jinah fixed her hair while pouting . </p>
<p>“How long will you treat me like a kid…”</p>
<p>Well, it wasn’t like she hated it .  She looked around, worried that someone might’ve seen .  After confirming no one was around, she skipped towards her classroom . </p>
<p>If he had to describe his first impression of Jinah’s homeroom teacher in a sentence . </p>
<p>‘Hmm…’</p>
<p>She looked like a virtuous person . </p>
<p>“You must be Jinah’s older brother . ”</p>
<p>She was a wise-looking middle-aged female teacher .  Someone whose bright smile made the other person feel comfortable .  Knowing the circumstances of his household, she did not question Jinwoo’s presence at all for the parent/guardian meeting . </p>
<p>“Please to meet you . I am Jinah’s homeroom teacher . I didn’t realize Jinah had such a handsome older brother, hoho . ”</p>
<p>At her sassy but pleasant greeting, Jinwoo bowed his head . </p>
<p>‘I don’t remember her while I was here . ’</p>
<p>She must’ve been a new teacher after he had graduated .  They say the first impression was very important . After their greeting, he was able to relax a bit . </p>
<p>‘She’s very respectful to someone much younger like me . ’</p>
<p>It appeared that his little sister’s senior year would not be plagued by a bad teacher . </p>
<p>“Please, have a seat . ”</p>
<p>She gestured toward a chair .  Jinwoo sat down and faced the teacher across a large desk . </p>
<p>“I don’t think you have to worry about Jinah . ”</p>
<p>They talked about the average matters for a parent/guardian meeting .  Their conversation continued in a good mood for some time . Because Jinah was a model student, her teacher had nothing but good things to say . </p>
<p>“You’re aware that Jinah wants to go to a medical school, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>The teacher read through Jinah’s profile . </p>
<p>“Her test scores were good, and her overall grades are excellent . She should be more than capable of getting into a good school . So please don’t put too much pressure on her . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo solemnly nodded .  The teacher’s face was filled with expectations for Jinah .  Truthfully, many homeroom teachers for highschool seniors were filled with stress due to the student’s grades .  After all, a student’s final years in highschool determined the course of their lives . [0]</p>
<p>‘And that’s why I heard most teachers wanted to avoid teaching seniors . ’</p>
<p>He had heard that some teachers had to be forced into the spot .  With that in mind, it was clear that Jinah’s teacher was someone with passion for the job .  As Jinah’s guardian, Jinwoo was very grateful for this . </p>
<p>The meeting was nearing its end after 15 minutes . </p>
<p>“And then…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was about to rise, but then the teacher carefully asked a question,</p>
<p>“I heard that Jinah’s oppa was a Hunter . ”</p>
<p>Her eyes had suddenly turned serious .  Jinwoo realized something was up . </p>
<p>“Yes, I am . ”</p>
<p>“If… Jinah underwent Awakening, would you let her work as a Hunter?”</p>
<p>. <strong>“Absolutely not . ”</strong>. </p>
<p>Never . </p>
<p>Jinwoo firmly replied .  He did not need to think about it .  The teacher’s expression darkened . </p>
<p>“As I expected…”</p>
<p>When Jinwoo looked at her suspiciously, the teacher continued with hesitation,</p>
<p>“If it’s not too much trouble, may I ask you for a favor?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded . </p>
<p>“If it’s something I can do…”</p>
<p>He’d hear her out at least .  The woman was Jinah’s teacher; he did not want to sour their relationship by cutting her off from the start .  Fearing that he would change his mind, the teacher quickly spoke,</p>
<p>“One of the female students here underwent Awakening recently . She’s planning on dropping out and starting work as a Hunter . She’s been absent for some time now . ”</p>
<p>‘Ah . ’</p>
<p>It was a common occurrence .  People who freshly received their Awakening ignored common sense and threw themselves into the Hunter profession .  Despite not knowing what the job truly entailed, they did it with pride at the fact that they were different from an ordinary person .  Even if you were an Awakened Being, taking on the title of a Hunter and earning life-changing amounts were difficult . </p>
<p>The teacher sighed deeply,</p>
<p>“If this continues, the school will have no choice but to take action . I want to avoid that if possible . Even if you were a Hunter, don’t you think you should atleast have a highschool diploma?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded in agreement .  At the positive response, the teacher’s face brightened a bit . </p>
<p>“Could you please convince her to at least consider graduating?”</p>
<p>The teacher smiled pleadingly .  Jinwoo asked a question out of curiosity,</p>
<p>“That student, what was her rank?”</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard… it was the lowest rank…”</p>
<p>E-rank . </p>
<p>‘ . She’s not going to live long . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo clicked his tongue inside his head .  Even just entering a Dungeon required a caution at that rank .  9 out of 10 times, entering a Dungeon with carefree attitude born of arrogance resulted in either becoming disabled or dying .  The fact that a girl his sister’s age might meet such a fate weighed heavily on Jinwoo . However, he knew this was her decision .  No one had forced her into it . It was unfortunate, but he did not want to take valuable time out of his schedule to interfere with someone else’s choice . </p>
<p>‘I’m not sure if I could even convince her . ’</p>
<p>People like that didn’t like being told what to do .  And so, Jinwoo decided to refuse and started to rise .  But the teacher continued,</p>
<p>“Her name is ___ . Jinah should know her . ” [1]</p>
<p>When he heard the student’s name, Jinwoo could not get up .  He asked to confirm,</p>
<p>“Teacher, what was her name again?”</p>
<p>“It’s ___ . Do you know her?” [2]</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>What a small world . </p>
<p>‘Huh…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was at a loss for words . </p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>At the same hour . </p>
<p>Yoojin Construction’s Chairman Yoo Myunghan’s personal residence . </p>
<p>From early morning, luxurious and expensive cars made nonstop appearances at the house . </p>
<p>They all had arrived for the same reason . </p>
<p>It was for the memorial service[3] of Yoojin Construction’s founding chairman, Yoo Byungcheol .  He was the father of Korea’s #1 businessman, Yoo Myunghan . The man’s firstborn made sure to clear all schedules, no matter how busy he was, and took care of his father’s memorial service every year .  As a testament to the man’s fierce demeanor and influence, the entire Yoo clan gathered as one on this day . </p>
<p>A certain investment firm’s president .  A certain pharmaceutical company’s chairman . A certain mall’s owner .  The members of the Yoo clan were filled with prominent heads of various business sectors .  Even their children were the elites among elites . Except for one . </p>
<p>That one person, without being told to do so, took up a spot quietly in a corner, acting as if he didn’t exist . </p>
<p>It was Yoo Jinho . [4]</p>
<p>‘Boring . ’</p>
<p>The young man wished this entire ceremony would be over soon .  Running through Dungeons with hyungnim was a hundred times, no, a thousand times more fun than this . </p>
<p>‘I wonder what hyungnim’s up to right now?’</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, he couldn’t imagine how Jinwoo would spend his day off .  Jinho idly thought about random things while sipping away at his drink, when a voice he didn’t want to hear spoke up from behind him . </p>
<p>“Oy . ”</p>
<p>Who else could it be? Even at a glance, you could tell that the voice’s owner was a man of talent .  Exuding the aura of an elite . Wearing high-class glasses . A tall height . </p>
<p>It was Yoo Jinho’s older brother, Yoo Jinsung .  The firstborn son of Yoo Myunghan . The heir who would control Yoojin Construction someday . </p>
<p>The man stood right before his younger brother and stared down on him . </p>
<p>“You should be up and about greeting the relatives . How long are you going to act like a little kid for?”</p>
<p>“ . Whatever . ”</p>
<p>“Know that your unseemly actions only besmirch the name of our father . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinsung’s words did not have a shred of brotherly love in them, only an utter disdain of looking down on someone inferior .  Of course, Yoo Jinho also had little love for his brother but did not dare speak up against him . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>His brother took after their father in many ways after all .  He was a genius among geniuses that stood at the top of the class in every subject, and his grades were just the tip of the iceberg .  Once he graduated, he quickly began working under his father, Yoo Myunghan, in various sectors of business and produced great results .  Compared to him, Yoo Jinho had nothing to show for himself . Even entering college was with the help of the family name . Whenever he stood next to his brother, Jinho felt himself shrinking down to nonexistence . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>“Pathetic . ”</p>
<p>The older brother frowned at the younger’s lowered head .  He quickly turned and walked away . </p>
<p>“Esteemed uncle . ”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s Jinsung . How are you?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho was able to finally raise his head after Yoo Jinsung had walked away .  This is why he hated coming home . If only it wasn’t his grandfather’s memorial service… While Yoo Jinho repeatedly sighed to himself, another familiar voice came from behind him . </p>
<p>“Wow, I really hate that guy . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho turned around .  It was his cousin, a year older than him, Yoo Soohyun . </p>
<p> .  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[0]: Might sound weird for folks in the west, but it’s really true in Korea .  There’s a reason why the country’s known for the immense amount of pressure parents put on their kids during highschool . </p>
<p>[1]: The original passage skips over the student’s name here . </p>
<p>[2]: Again, the name is not written down in the original passage . </p>
<p>[3]: “memorial service” (제사): In Korea (and I think most east asian countries), families go the extra mile when it comes to remembering the dead, specifically their elders that have passed .  Large families would gather the entire clan into one place for remembrance . </p>
<p>[4]: Aww . </p>
