<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 73</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>Volkhan fell .  From the dust blown up by its giant body, Jinwoo stepped out .  He looked around . He was about to go to the aid of his army, but it looked like they were finishing up as well . </p>
<p>“Kiiiiek!”</p>
<p>“Kekek!”</p>
<p>“Keeeek!”</p>
<p>With the combined might of the Shadow Army, Volkhan’s minions rapidly fell left and right . </p>
<p>‘Status screen . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked over his status .  Because he had just leveled up, he had recovered all of his health, mana and stamina . </p>
<p>‘With my mana refreshed, I don’t need to help them . ’</p>
<p>As long as there was mana, the Shadow Soldiers were immortal .  That was the power of the undead army . Deciding to leave the trash mobs to the soldiers, Jinwoo turned back to Volkhan’s corpse to collect the drops . </p>
<p>“Hmm . ”</p>
<p>It felt like he was about to open his Christmas gifts .  Jinwoo could not help but smile while looking at Volkhan’s body . </p>
<p>‘Wonder what I’ll get?’</p>
<p>There were multiple lights coming from the corpse .  As always, Jinwoo stretched a hand towards the light .  The item message appeared . </p>
<p>ring~!</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>[1]</strong>. </p>
<p>Jinwoo had a good feeling while fighting Volkhan .  As expected, multiple items dropped from the boss’s corpse .  A joy filled the Hunter’s face as he looked over the drops . </p>
<p>‘Of course, Volkhan’s Horns are probably junk items . ’</p>
<p>Just looking at the name and the amount acquired, Jinwoo was sure Volkhan’s Horns were the same as the horns dropped by the other demons: just junk items to be sold .  That left the other three items… One of them grabbed Jinwoo’s attention . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve found a crafting ingredient, “Fragment of the World Tree”</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to acquire it?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Crafting ingredient?’</p>
<p>What could he craft with it? Or was it part of the quest? His curiosity peaked at the new type of item he had found .  In order to read the item’s information, he had to first solidify the item from the light . And so, Jinwoo decided to pick up all the items . </p>
<p>“Acquire all . ”</p>
<p>The multiple lights disappeared from Volkhan’s corpse, and an equal amount of physical objects appeared in front of Jinwoo out of thin air .  Two earrings, a red marble…</p>
<p> . And a giant piece of wood the size of a grown man . </p>
<p>Jinwoo instantly knew which one of these was the Fragment of the World Tree .  He stared at the giant piece of lumber, and the corresponding information popped up . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Fragment of the World Tree</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: ??</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Ingredient</strong>.   </p>
<p>Volkhan’s Club was made out of wood from the World Tree . This piece of wood remained after the contaminated parts were removed from the club . The wood obtained from the World Tree contains a strong magic power and is the highest-class material for crafting magic items . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘The ingredient for the highest-class magic items . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo wanted to know just what he could make with this thing .  Unfortunately, that information was nowhere to be found . Still, it was certain this was not an ordinary item .  Standing close to it, he was able to feel a powerful energy emanating from the piece of wood . </p>
<p>‘I have a feeling… this wood will be useful somehow . ’</p>
<p>Instead of selling it, Jinwoo put the Fragment of the World Tree into his inventory .  He pored over the other items’ information . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Monarch of Demons’ Earrings</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: S</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Accessory</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Strength +20, Constitution +20</strong>.   </p>
<p>Set: The Crown Jewels of the Monarch of Demons[2]</p>
<p>  1 . The Monarch of Demons’ Earrings</p>
<p>  2 . The Monarch of Demons’ Necklace</p>
<p><strong>  3 . The Monarch of Demons’ Ring</strong>.   </p>
<p>Set Bonus:</p>
<p>  1 . ??? (2 Items)</p>
<p>  2 . ??? (3 Items)</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘A set item?’</p>
<p>While the base effects were similar to the A-rank Gatekeeper’s Necklace, the Monarch of Demons’ Earrings had an unknown set effect .  Even without knowing the set effects, it was an amazing item, increasing both strength and constitution by 20 points . </p>
<p>‘Since one level-up is equivalent to five stat points . ’</p>
<p>In that line of thought, this was the same as leveling up eight times .  With a happy heart, Jinwoo picked up the earrings . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to equip the “Monarch of Demons’ Earrings”?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Equip . ’</p>
<p>Like always, the earrings disappeared and its effects were applied to Jinwoo .  He smiled in satisfaction at his increased stats . </p>
<p>The Crown Jewels of the Monarch of Demons . </p>
<p>‘I’m sure the other pieces will drop here . ’</p>
<p>With a name that included the word “Demon”, it was to easy to understand that the full set would drop from a place called Demon Castle .  Just what would the set effects be? Even though he had obtained only one part, Jinwoo’s expectations were great . However, his smile would soon disappear . </p>
<p>‘This is…?’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Marble of Avarice</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: A</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Magic Tool</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Effect ‘Desire for Destruction’: Your magic damage is doubled . </strong>.   </p>
<p>It’s a marble made from the blood of the archdemon Volkhan . The marble will empower the wielder’s magic and increase the destruction caused . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>It was a red ball the size of a billiard ball .  Jinwoo held the Marble of Avarice in his hand . There was no change to his stats .  He pulled up the skill information on the only thing he had that might qualify as magic, his class-specific shadow skills, but there were no changes .  The limits on the number of shadows remained the same . </p>
<p>‘Is it not something I could benefit from?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head . </p>
<p>Doubling the magic damage .  Its effects were incredible .  </p>
<p>Out in the real world, magic tools that empowered the user’s magic were prohibitively expensive .  Because of that, they were only used by a handful of the Mage-class Hunters . However, Jinwoo had never heard of an artifact that increased your offensive power by a 100% .  If something like this was found, it would’ve made waves across the entire world . There was no way someone had kept something like that hidden . </p>
<p>And here he was, holding an item that doubled one’s magic damage . </p>
<p>‘Still, it’s useless to me . ’</p>
<p>An item that simply increased magic damage did nothing for him .  After all, the shadow skills technically did not do damage on their own .  His offensive skills weren’t even magic . If only an item that increased intelligence appeared . </p>
<p>‘Tsk . ’</p>
<p>While he tossed the marble up and down disappointedly, the Shadow Soldiers had finished the trash mobs and gathered before him .  The fastest among them was Ygritte . </p>
<p>Three in his right hand .  Three in his left hand . </p>
<p>The knight walked up to Jinwoo and placed six demons’ heads in front of the Hunter . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo scratched his temple while looking at the kneeling knight . </p>
<p>“Could you please stop doing that?”</p>
<p>Of course, the respectfully bowed head of the knight did not reply . </p>
<p>“Because when you do that…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was not sure when the other knight managed to do it, but Iron had cut off Volkhan’s head and dragged it over to his master as well . </p>
<p>“ . He also does it . ”</p>
<p>‘I mean, I’m the one who took it down, right?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo fixed his gaze on Iron and sighed deeply .  Looking at the kneeling giant knight, an interesting idea occurred to him . </p>
<p>‘What if I can give the Marble of Avarice to one of them like how I was able to use Iron’s shield?’</p>
<p>Right on cue, the Shadow Mages were slowly approaching Jinwoo behind the infantry .  Compared to the knights or even the infantry, the mages were rather slow . Jinwoo called over the nearest one to him .  When he gestured with his hand, the indicated mage slowly walked over to his master . </p>
<p>‘ . Maybe I should go to him . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo shook his head then quickly walked over to the mage .  He placed the Marble of Avarice onto the mage’s hand, then pointed to the building he had used to jump towards Volkhan .  As the Shadow Soldiers moved according to his will, he did not particularly need to explain the details . </p>
<p>Jinwoo gave the signal,</p>
<p>“Fire . ”</p>
<p>With it, a fireball twice the size of what he was used to seeing appeared in the mage’s hands . </p>
<p>‘Whoa!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened .  Ignoring his shock, the fireball flew from the mage’s hands . </p>
<p>WOOOOOSH-!</p>
<p>BAAAAAANG!</p>
<p>“Wha-!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s mouth opened wide .  The building was swallowed by the explosion and blew apart like a toy house .  The fire consuming the building did not look like it could be put out easily . </p>
<p>Flaaaare!</p>
<p>Watching the fireworks caused by the mage’s spell, Jinwoo quickly took back the Marble of Avarice .  He pored over the item information, looking for a specific phrase,</p>
<p>‘It’s not there . It’s really not there . ’</p>
<p>No matter how much he looked up and down on the description, the item did not say that it was untradable .  Did that mean he could sell this?</p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked back at the burning building . </p>
<p>flaaare!</p>
<p>Even few parts of the building that remained standing fell eventually with a crashing sound .  Jinwoo smiled at the destruction . </p>
<p>‘This thing…’</p>
<p>It’ll drive the Mage-class Hunters crazy .  His disappointment was nowhere to be seen, replaced by an anticipation . </p>
<p>A bright afternoon . </p>
<p>“The young man in 902?”</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman thought for a moment then replied,</p>
<p>“Hmm, I’m not sure . Haven’t seen him around lately . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, okay . Thank you . ”</p>
<p>Hyun Gicheol bowed his head .  It had been four days since the deputy had been waiting for Jinwoo near his house, but the man had not ran into the Hunter .  He had been making vegetable juice nonstop . With a sigh, he took out his phone . </p>
<p>ring~ ring~</p>
<p>Someone picked up . </p>
<p>- “Oy, Gicheol . ”</p>
<p>“Chief . ”</p>
<p>It was Chief Ahn Sangmin . </p>
<p>“I haven’t seen Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim . The neighbors also said they haven’t seen him recently . ”</p>
<p>- “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . ”</p>
<p>- “Well, can’t be helped . Start coming to the office tomorrow, then . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . Understood . ”</p>
<p>click</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin hung up and tilted his head .  Where did Hunter Sung Jinwoo go? The man fell off the grid few days ago . Thinking that he might be purposely avoiding their calls, Hyun Gicheol was sent to the Hunter’s residence but could not find him .  The Second Management Division Chief began to worry if something had gone wrong . </p>
<p>‘Well, not sure who’s worrying about whom . ’</p>
<p>Still, the man felt restless . </p>
<p>tap tap</p>
<p>Someone tapped him on the shoulder .  Turning around, he saw Hunter Park Heejin behind to him . </p>
<p>“According to his little sister, he’s gone on a trip with a friend for about a week . ”</p>
<p>“Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim?”</p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case… I don’t think the destination is on Earth . ”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Park Heejin was taken aback .  Ahn Sangmin quickly explained,</p>
<p>“There’s no record of him leaving the country . And there are also no records of him pulling funds or using his card from the bank . ”</p>
<p>“You can obtain that kind of information?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s our job to keep an eye on Hunters . ”</p>
<p>“Oh my . ”</p>
<p>“On top of that, according to the Association’s tracking records, the last place he was noted in was in the middle of the city, five days ago . Isn’t it all too mysterious?”</p>
<p>“Do you think he got kidnapped?”</p>
<p>The moment the words left her mouth, she realized how stupid they sounded .  The pair met each other’s eyes and laughed . </p>
<p>Just who was Sung Jinwoo? He was the man who solo cleared a high-level Dungeon, a Red Gate at that .  Ahn Sangmin scratched his cheek and spoke,</p>
<p>“If you want to nab Hunter Sung Jinwoo-nim, you’ll need to call in that Chinese special forces unit . The one solely comprised of Hunters . ”</p>
<p>Park Heejin nodded in agreement .  Stifling his laughter, Ahn Sangmin became curious and asked a question,</p>
<p>“By the way, how did you find out that he was going on a trip?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it was Han Songyi . We still keep in touch . She goes to the same school as Sung Jinwoo-ssi’s little sister, so I asked her to find out . ”</p>
<p>“Aha…”</p>
<p>With that, the pair’s conversation was over .  But they were thinking the same thing,</p>
<p>‘Just where did the man go?’</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: Lots of item names</p>
<p>1 . “Monarch of Demons’ Earrings” (악마 군주의 귀고리): Pretty literal . The word used for “monarch” is the same words as “Monarch of Shadows” .  “Demon” 악마 + “monarch/king/lord” 군주 + “earrings” 귀고리 . One thing to note here, just like “Shadow Monarch vs . Monarch of Shadows”, 악마군주 is more closely read “Demon Monarch or Demonic Monarch” . I am making a purposeful style choice to flip the words . </p>
<p>2 . “Marble of Avarice” (탐욕의 구슬): Pretty literal .  Same word “Avarice” as Volkhan’s title . “greed/avarice” 탐욕 + “marble” 구슬</p>
<p>3 . “Fragment of the World Tree” (세계수의 파편): Also literal . “world tree” 세계수 + “fragment” 파편 .  “World tree” can also refer to Yggdrasil from nordic mythology, but I don’t know if it fit the context of the story . </p>
<p>[2]: Original korean says the “Accessory Series of the Monarch of Demons” (악마 군주 장신구 시리즈) . I styled it up a bit . </p>
