<h3>Chapter 191: Chapter 191</h3> <p>Thomas Andre’s brows quivered slightly </p>
<p>If some insignificant Hunter said that to him, he’d have ripped that fool into tiny bits and shreds immediately </p>
<p>After all, the United States government wouldn’t be able to prosecute him, a Special Authority-rank Hunter, that easily . He was someone possessing rights equal to that of a country </p>
<p>As the reward for rescuing 300 million American lives from the worst calamity in human history, Thomas Andre got to wield absolute power . This power allowed him to do whatever he pleased </p>
<p>However, even if that was the case, he couldn’t immediately make his move . Because his opponent this time was none other than ‘Seong Jin-Woo’ </p>
<p>Thomas Andre couldn’t completely suppress his temper and his hands moved for a blink of an eye . He managed to reel himself back in, though . He glared at Hwang Dong-Su and gritted his teeth </p>
<p>‘And I told him not to provoke that man… . ’. </p>
<p>As expected, Seong Jin-Woo was not an easy opponent to face . Seeing him personally confirmed this fact . If Thomas Andre had to describe this feeling into words, then it was like trying to step into a quagmire </p>
<p>Dark and ominous magical energy oozed out from Seong Jin-Woo’s entire body, and Thomas Andre felt as if he’d not be able to escape once he took a wrong step forward here </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even he could not back away now . An ace Hunter of the Scavenger Guild was currently being manhandled by that man, and most importantly, his pride as a Special Authority-rank Hunter was at stake, too </p>
<p>With his expression viciously crumpled, Thomas Andre threw out a question </p>
<p>“… . You, by any chance, don’t you know who I am?”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo curtly responded </p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter who you are . ”. </p>
<p>It was then – Hwang Dong-Su somehow regained his consciousness and shouted out after discovering Thomas Andre </p>
<p>“Master! Kill this son of a b*tch! Hurry!”. </p>
<p>Boom!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s fist struck Hwang Dong-Su, causing the man to black out and go limp again . Meanwhile, veins bulged on Thomas Andre’s forehead </p>
<p>“You dare… . ”. </p>
<p>‘… . You know who I am, yet you dare to do something like that in my presence?’. </p>
<p>His expression was already crumpled into something unsightly before, but now, it distorted even more to resemble a devil’s face </p>
<p>Through personal experience, his body knew how one should deal with an opponent who didn’t want to submit </p>
<p>‘White trash; a low-class white man . ’. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre grew up in a poor immigrant family </p>
<p>The school located in the poorest ghetto filled with African youths proved to be a hostile place for a lone white kid who knew no one and had no friends or acquaintances </p>
<p>Everywhere was filled with enemies . Just from meeting eyes did the fights break out . And often, his opponents carried around dangerous weapons, too . The moments when he had to fight off multiple enemies happened frequently, as well </p>
<p>However, the heavens saw fit to bestow a certain gift that could only be described as unprecedented unto this white kid who seemingly possessed nothing </p>
<p>The overwhelming talent for physical power – the power that allowed him to trample on others!. </p>
<p>Paradoxically, the boy’s surroundings became just about a perfect playground for him to confirm his own talents . Through the endless, continuous fights, the boy got to confirm the heaven-gifted talent he possessed </p>
<p>He clearly witnessed how his powers would change all those holding hostile feeling towards him . And so, he reigned like a king </p>
<p>Power – the authoritative power, financial power, and physical power . He got to learn quite early on that the many types of power existing in this world could turn a man into either a king or a slave </p>
<p>And when a completely different type of ‘power’ manifested into this world, he grasped the opportunity and ascended to the status of a true king </p>
<p>If an opponent was unwilling to listen, then he’d use power to make them submit . Someone blocking his path would be destroyed without mercy </p>
<p>And he’d make all those looking down on him kneel on the ground, defeated . Physical power was the truth!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre stayed true to what he knew, to what he was familiar with </p>
<p>Time seemed to freeze up . Thomas Andre, now full of malice and a destructive desire, pounced forward . The distance between the two men disappeared in an instant </p>
<p>His eyes met Jin-Woo’s, as they closed in enough for their noses to touch </p>
<p>‘Blame your own ignorance!’. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre reached out with his hand . He was planning to grab Jin-Woo’s head </p>
<p>His incomprehensible gripping power was one of his many hidden talents . Even if his opponent happened to be a top-ranked Hunter, he’d easily shatter that person’s skull </p>
<p>Now that the fool was within his attacking range, victory was as good as his . The corners of Thomas Andre’s lips curled up </p>
<p>Too bad, though…. </p>
<p>‘Wha… . ?!’. </p>
<p>In that instant, there was a flash of light before his eyes </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>With fortunate timing, the Hunters of the Scavenger Guild arrived at the location . And they all got to witness something peculiar . They got to witness ‘something’ breaking past a wall of the disused factory at an alarming speed </p>
<p>Boooom-!!. </p>
<p>That ‘something’ destroyed the wall and crash-landed on the ground . Even then, it continued to slide away for a long, long time </p>
<p>Chuwuuuuk…. </p>
<p>And when that ‘something’ finally stopped sliding right before their eyes, the Hunters recognised its identity and couldn’t hide their extreme astonishment from exploding out . No one could tell who cried out first </p>
<p>“Thomas Andre?!”. </p>
<p>“Master, are you alright?!”. </p>
<p>Just who managed to blow away the Goliath like this?. </p>
<p>They simply couldn’t believe it </p>
<p>The force of the impact was so great that hot steam was still rising up from Thomas Andre’s entire body </p>
<p>But then again, the skin on a regular person would’ve been torn to shreds as he slid on the ground like that . No, before that, his body would’ve broken into many pieces after slamming into the wall, instead </p>
<p>However, Thomas Andre was perfectly fine . Should one say, as befitting of a tanker who managed to survive Kamish’s Breath with nothing but his bare body?. </p>
<p>It was just that the expression he was making as he stood back up was not perfectly fine at all . His face hardened like a surface of a boulder as he stood up . He then took a sweeping look at his Hunters </p>
<p>Even though they were on the same side, these Hunters paled instantly after being subjected to the murderous glare of a Special Authority-rank Hunter </p>
<p>“… ”. </p>
<p>Without saying anything else, Thomas Andre walked back into the abandoned factory he flew out from . A dizzying amount of killing intent erupted out from his entire body </p>
<p>Step, step </p>
<p>The Vice-Master staring at that sight in a daze hurriedly regained his wits and urged the Guild’s Hunters </p>
<p>“What are you all doing? Get a move on, now!”. </p>
<p>One hundred or so top-ranked Hunters all rushed into the abandoned factory at once </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>After blowing Thomas Andre away, Jin-Woo clenched his fist tighter </p>
<p>Just a second later, and Yu Jin-Ho’s life would have been in grave danger . It felt like his blood would boil over when he saw Hwang Dong-Su slamming the kid’s head to the floor through the eyes of the High Orc soldier </p>
<p>But, that man wanted what now?. </p>
<p>He’d pretend that none of this happened if Hwang Dong-Su was released? What a stupid suggestion that was </p>
<p>Jin-Woo pushed himself to the absolute limit and continued to grow further and further so he’d not get pushed around by powerful beings . So, such a dumb demand wasn’t even worth his time to consider </p>
<p>But then, the response from Thomas Andre was an attack filled to the brim with the intent to kill </p>
<p>This battle was far from over </p>
<p>Thomas Andre might have been flung away to a far off distance, but he made his way back with an even stronger intent to kill than before . Jin-Woo discarded the still-unconscious Hwang Dong-Su to a corner of the factory . And then, summoned Kaisel and Igrit out </p>
<p>Shururuk…. </p>
<p>A black Sky Dragon and a black knight revealed themselves . Jin-Woo carefully lifted up Yu Jin-Ho and handed the kid over to Igrit </p>
<p>“Take Jin-Ho to the nearest hospital . Make sure he gets the necessary treatment . Got it?”. </p>
<p>Igrit bowed to display his understanding and jumped on the back of Kaisel to fly out of the factory </p>
<p>Kii-ahk!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre didn’t give a d*mn about the escaping Sky Dragon . No, his glare was firmly locked on Jin-Woo and Jin-Woo alone . Likewise, Jin-Woo’s glare was redirected to the American, as well </p>
<p>And he got to see the crumpled expression of Thomas Andre and top-ranked Hunters rushing inside beyond his shoulders . Their number was around one hundred </p>
<p>It seemed that this guy mobilised and brought along all the elites of the Scavenger Guild, often referred to as the best Guild in the world </p>
<p>The thing was, though… </p>
<p>‘…If you want to compare the number of soldiers, then I too have more than enough . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo immediately called out his Shadow Soldiers hiding within his shadow and waiting for his commands . The darkness slowly spread out from beneath his feet, and one by one, the Shadow Soldiers rose up from the ground </p>
<p>Thomas Andre’s steps came to a halt after he discovered all those soldiers . The number was somewhere near one thousand . The abandoned factory was completely filled up in an instant, but even then, the columns of soldiers extended well beyond to the back as well </p>
<p>Thomas Andre narrowed his eyes </p>
<p>‘It’s not just the incredible numbers, either . ’. </p>
<p>He even spotted several summoned creatures that were easily on a similar level as rank S Hunters . Such as the knight holding a massive shield, or the Mage wearing a black robe, and even those Giants occupying the backline, too </p>
<p>Their magical energy emission didn’t lose out to some of the highest-ranked Hunters out there </p>
<p>Indeed, these were truly excellent summoned creatures that even the entirety of the Scavenger Guild participating could not guarantee a victory against </p>
<p>Shiver, shiver… </p>
<p>Seeing Seong Jin-Woo’s common sense-breaking summons in the flesh, Thomas Andre felt this powerful shudder run up through his entire body . At the same time, he was feeling genuinely happy </p>
<p>‘That’s right . ’. </p>
<p>Wouldn’t he truly get to enjoy the fight now that the level of his opponent was this high?. </p>
<p>A smile broke out on Thomas Andre’s face as he licked his lips . That fool Hwang Dong-Su no longer mattered in this fight </p>
<p>There was only one way to restore his damaged pride . And that would be to…. </p>
<p>‘… . Kill that impudent b*stard… . ’. </p>
<p>But, before he did that, Thomas Andre made his final offer of mercy </p>
<p>“If you admit to your mistakes and back off, I promise I’ll spare your life . ”. </p>
<p>Instead of a verbal answer, Jin-Woo simply flipped him a bird </p>
<p>“… ”. </p>
<p>Thick veins bulged all over on Thomas Andre’s forehead </p>
<p>“You f*cker, right until the end… . ”. </p>
<p>Riiip!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre ripped his shirt off – a shirt made out of top-class material extracted from the monsters was ripped into pieces like a sheet of cheap paper </p>
<p>And then… </p>
<p>Wududuk-!. </p>
<p>Wuduk!. </p>
<p>The muscles in his entire torso ballooned up and hardened like armour covering his whole body . Magic energy so vast that it raised goosebumps from the people nearby leaked out from beneath his feet . It was so vast and powerful, in fact, it looked as if gold-coloured steam was slowly rising up from his shoulders </p>
<p>The world’s greatest Tanker had released his full might once more </p>
<p>Jin-Woo wordlessly watched Thomas Andre’s transformation before unleashing his own magical energy as well </p>
<p>Shuwahaahk-!!. </p>
<p>The magic energy emitted from two monsters occupying wholly different realms forced the surrounding elite Hunters to hold their breaths </p>
<p>‘Heok!’. </p>
<p>‘I was wondering just who it was that blew away the Goliath, but now… . ’. </p>
<p>Their gazes were directed to one location – to Seong Jin-Woo </p>
<p>For sure, that feat sounded plausible if it was Seong Jin-Woo, who managed to hunt down all those Giant monsters in Japan </p>
<p>The Hunters of the Scavenger Guild nervously swallowed their saliva as they stared at Jin-Woo </p>
<p>Unlike them and their heightened state of tension, though, Jin-Woo was completely calm and collected . He felt that this was the perfect opportunity to test out his growth up until now . He was now facing an opponent that he could definitely go all out against </p>
<p>Abruptly, Jin-Woo recalled what Kamish the Dragon had told him </p>
<p>‘There are four people borrowing the Rulers’ powers, right?’. </p>
<p>Could it be that those four were among the five survivors of the Kamish raid – the four of the Special Authority-rank Hunters?. </p>
<p>If that was true, then the odds of Thomas Andre being a human borrowing the Rulers’ powers were very high </p>
<p>Jin-Woo made the first move </p>
<p>“Advance . ”. </p>
<p>Almost immediately after their Sovereign issued that command, the Shadow Soldiers rushed forward with rather scary vigour </p>
<p>Thomas Andre also cried out loudly </p>
<p>“They are coming!”. </p>
<p>One man versus one Guild; nearly one thousand ‘summons’ and almost one hundred elite Hunters collided violently on this day </p>
<p>Boom-!!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre blew away Iron standing at the front of the pack and quickly searched for Jin-Woo’s whereabouts as a bright glare shot out from his eyes </p>
<p>He spotted someone rushing towards him at an incredible pace  </p>
<p>‘Over there-!!’. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre turned around, but Jin-Woo was faster . The latter dug into the former’s defence in an instant and stabbed at the waist with the ‘Demon King’s Shortsword’ </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the blade failed to break past the hardened skin of Thomas Andre </p>
<p>‘… . !’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s eyes widened </p>
<p>Pow!. </p>
<p>The American blew his opponent away with his elbow as a smirk formed on his face </p>
<p>This was the true power of the Special Authority-rank Hunter . Jin-Woo might possess a pretty decent turn of speed, but there was no way he’d be able to exceed Thomas Andre’s defences </p>
<p>‘Feel my power and taste what true despair is like!’. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre judged that the advantage was now with him . He didn’t stop his attacks there and reached out with his hand </p>
<p>Wuuonng-!. </p>
<p>When he did, a powerful pulling force was generated from his hand and quickly reeled back the flung-away Jin-Woo </p>
<p>The ‘invisible hand’ </p>
<p>This was Thomas Andre’s ability that managed to drag Kamish the Dragon from the air to the ground </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was brought back closer to Thomas Andre at a frightening turn of speed, but then, his eyes shot open again </p>
<p>‘Ruler’s Authority!’. </p>
<p>Koo-woong!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre’s shoulders quivered from the unseen force slamming down from above </p>
<p>‘What?!’. </p>
<p>He was left utterly stunned after confirming with his entire body that his opponent also possessed the power only the Special Authority-rank Hunters possessed </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn’t miss that opening; his punch slammed into Thomas Andre’s face for the second time today </p>
<p>Ka-boom!!. </p>
<p>And for the first time ever after becoming a Hunter, the man nicknamed Goliath spat out blood from his mouth </p>
<p>“Keo-heok!!”. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The Hunter Bureau wasn’t sitting back sucking on its fingers either . Dozens of vehicles belonging to the Bureau carrying Hunters were on their way to the same destination as the members of the Scavenger Guild </p>
<p>However, the two cars right in front of the pack suddenly came to a halt not too far from their destination </p>
<p>The deeply-anxious Adam White had been watching the passing scenery and was caught unprepared from the sudden stop </p>
<p>“Wha-what is going on?”. </p>
<p>The vehicle’s driver looked back at Adam White . He was the sole rank S Hunter affiliated with the Hunter Bureau </p>
<p>“Agent White . I think it’s time you explained to us what’s going on here . ”. </p>
<p>“We don’t have time for me to explain everything in… . ”. </p>
<p>Adam White couldn’t finish his sentence </p>
<p>Because he saw the complexion of the rank S Hunter growing pale rather quickly at that moment . It was the first time seeing such an expression forming on the face of a man who famously possessed a steely heart, formed after experiencing all sorts of close shaves in his life </p>
<p>Realising that something quite serious had happened, Adam White quickly asked </p>
<p>“Did… . something happen up ahead?”. </p>
<p>The rank S Hunter replied with a frozen-stiff face </p>
<p>“If we continue on, all of us will have to risk our lives . ”. </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 191 &gt; Fin </p>
