<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 7</p>
<p>Front .  Back . Left .  Right . </p>
<p>To cover the four cardinal directions, a minimum of four people were needed . </p>
<p>Jinwoo, Juhee, Mr . Song and Mr . Kim . </p>
<p>If even one more person left amongst the remaining four, a gap would open up in their coverage . </p>
<p>“Mr . Sung, what’s happening? Please explain . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim asked while wiping away the sweat on his forehead . </p>
<p>“We just have to wait like this! Until all of the blue flames disappear!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo revealed all that he had surmised .  Mr . Kim listened with attention and nodded along .  Finishing his explanation, Jinwoo added,</p>
<p>“We can all survive this . ”</p>
<p>The rules of this room always opened a path to survival for those that followed it .  The last rule should be no different . As long as they believed in each other, everyone could leave without being hurt .  This was Jinwoo’s conclusion . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim’s thoughts were different .  He asked after hesitating,</p>
<p>“Mr . Sung… You might be correct on all this, but… Isn’t there a possibility that the door might just close once the timer ends?”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo could not answer him .  Although his theory was gathered from the multiple trials and the evidence observed so far, it was not 100% guaranteed that he was correct . </p>
<p>And Mr . Kim needed an assurance .  To him, the certainty of his own survival outweighed the uncertain survival of the entire group . </p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I don’t think I can do this . ”</p>
<p>“Ahjussi!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry . ”</p>
<p>And with that, Mr . Kim stepped off of the altar .  Ignoring Jinwoo’s voice, he ran towards the door . After taking one last look at the people he left behind, Mr . Kim went through the door and did not come back . </p>
<p>Jinwoo clenched and grinded his teeth . </p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>He had saved their lives .  Instead of repaying his actions with kindness and gratitude, they betrayed him . </p>
<p>As expected, a hole appeared in their coverage of the statues . </p>
<p>griiiiiind~</p>
<p>sliiiiiide~</p>
<p>The statues inched closer and closer towards the group . </p>
<p>After looking at their surroundings, Mr . Song spoke to Jinwoo and Juhee . </p>
<p>“You guys should go . ”</p>
<p>It was a voice filled with resignation . </p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his head and looked at the man . </p>
<p>“Ahjussi…?”</p>
<p>“Mr . Kim was right .  Who was it that brought you all here? It’s only right that I remain behind . ”</p>
<p><strong>“But!”</strong>.  . </p>
<p>“If anyone should live, it’s you youngins with your many years of life remaining . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Song smiled .  They were words meant to comfort the two that would have to leave him behind . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded in defeat .  His heart was heavy, but they were not in a situation where they could argue on who should stay and who should go . </p>
<p>“Ms . Juhee, could you please take Jinwoo?”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>But suddenly, Juhee who was approaching the two men collapsed onto the ground . </p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Struggling to get up, tears filled her eyes . </p>
<p>“I… I can’t move my legs…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo and Mr . Song’s expressions darkened .  She was not in a good state . Her lips had turned blue, and her entire body was spasming lightly .  It was the side effect of overusing one’s mana to near emptiness, made worse in her exhausted state . </p>
<p>‘Only because she tried to heal my leg…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo struggled to speak as the guilt weighed heavily upon his heart .  But this was not a time to waste away like this . </p>
<p>griiiiiind~</p>
<p>sliiiiiide~</p>
<p>The statues were continuing to move towards the center of the room . </p>
<p>Jinwoo pulled away from Mr . Song’s arms and collapsed onto the floor of the altar . </p>
<p>Mr . Song’s eyes widened,</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo spoke to him with a determined look,</p>
<p>“Ahjussi, please take Juhee and get out of here . ”</p>
<p>“I told you, I would remain . ”</p>
<p>“Then who will take Juhee?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo wasn’t able to walk on his own .  It was impossible for him to take Juhee, also incapacitated, to the doors . </p>
<p>‘Of course…’</p>
<p>There was the option of leaving her behind . </p>
<p>But she was someone who had saved his life countless times before .  And even her current state was due to spending all her mana in efforts to heal him .  He hated the thought of carrying the guilt of leaving such a person behind for the rest of his life</p>
<p>“There’s no time .  Please go . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Song picked up Juhee with a heavy expression .  Juhee cried and shook her head in defiance . </p>
<p>“No… we can’t… Jinwoo, you can leave, I’ll stay behind…”</p>
<p>“I promised to buy you dinner, right?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo took out the E-rank magic core from his pocket and placed it in Juhee’s hand . </p>
<p>“Go ahead first and eat with this .  I’ll come collect the change later . ”</p>
<p>Juhee flared at his smile . </p>
<p>“How could you even joke in a time like this!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded toward Mr . Song, who struck the back of Juhee’s neck, knocking her out .  Mr . Song carried her over his right shoulder . </p>
<p>“ . I’m sorry . ”</p>
<p>“It’s my decision, after all . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Song bowed his head toward Jinwoo, and stepped down from the altar with Juhee . </p>
<p>The statues were quickly nearing the altar . </p>
<p>Sitting down, Jinwoo took in a deep breath . </p>
<p>Noticing the sword that Mr . Kim had left behind, he reached out and grabbed it . </p>
<p>‘Now that it’s like this .  I’m going to take at least one of you with me . ’</p>
<p>Turning around, he saw Mr . Song and Juhee safely make it through the open doors . </p>
<p>‘Thank god… I’m the only one that’ll die now . ’</p>
<p>It was not a sentiment borne of some noble self-sacrifice .  Just a matter of simple calculation . Even if he got out somehow, he would have to live the rest of his life as a cripple .  Forget being a Hunter, it wouldn’t be possible for him to even live a normal life . With no special talents or learned skills, he did not see a happy life ahead of him . </p>
<p>‘Then there’s mother’s hospital bills… and Jinah’s education expenses…’</p>
<p>Since there was no way he’d be able to support them with this injury, he thought to at least provide for them through his death . </p>
<p>‘Let’s see, the compensation for death during a Raid was… three hundred million won to the surviving family? Or was it four hundred million?’</p>
<p>Compared to the worthless life of an E-ranker, it was a rather generous compensation . </p>
<p>griiiiiind~</p>
<p>sliiiiiide~</p>
<p>*Stop*</p>
<p>They were here . </p>
<p>The first statue to arrive took a step towards the altar . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked towards him and raised his sword . </p>
<p>“Come . ”</p>
<p>But the first attack came from behind . </p>
<p>*Stab*</p>
<p>The spear that pierced his back now protruded out of his chest . </p>
<p>“cough~”</p>
<p>Jinwoo threw up a large amount of blood .  The pain assaulted his senses like hail . </p>
<p>“If the place you were stabbed in was just a bit higher, it would’ve pierced your heart!”</p>
<p>Juhee’s words from earlier flashed across his mind . </p>
<p>“Wu-wuaaaaak!”</p>
<p>The statue raised its spear and with it, Jinwoo .  Still skewered to the weapon, Jinwoo found himself suspended in air .  As he flailed his legs in pain, the statue slammed him towards the ground . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>crack crack crack</p>
<p>He heard the sound of bones breaking throughout his entire body .  There was nowhere he did not feel pain . </p>
<p>One by one, the statues gathered around the convulsing Jinwoo, who glared up at them . </p>
<p>‘I don’t… I don’t want to die like this…’</p>
<p>As death crept closer and closer, tears formed in his eyes . </p>
<p>His family appeared in his mind .  Juhee, who worried for him until the last minute, also appeared in his mind . </p>
<p>‘I don’t want to die…’</p>
<p>To end his life at a young age of 24 . </p>
<p>step-</p>
<p>A statue wielding a sword walked towards him with an expressionless face . </p>
<p>Even as his entire body shook, Jinwoo did not look away from its gaze . </p>
<p>Finally, the statue’s raised sword fell down towards him . </p>
<p>‘Just one more, if I had just one more chance!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened at the falling sword . </p>
<p>It was in that moment . </p>
<p>tickticktick tick tick   tick tick tick            tick… . </p>
<p>As if someone had pressed the pause button on a video, the falling sword stopped before his eyes . </p>
<p>No, not stopped . </p>
<p>Slowed to a crawl, almost as if it was stopped . </p>
<p>Millimeter by millimeter, the sword was definitely still coming down at him . </p>
<p>‘W-what?’</p>
<p>He could not hide his surprise . </p>
<p>Then, a female voice he had never heard before in his life rang throughout his head . </p>
<p>[You have fulfilled all conditions of the ‘Secret Quest: The Weak One’s Courage’ . ]</p>
<p>Secret quest? Fulfilled all conditions?</p>
<p>He had no idea what it was saying . </p>
<p>‘No, before that, where is that voice coming from?’</p>
<p>Ignoring his thoughts, the voice continued . </p>
<p>[You’ve obtained the right to become a Player .  Do you accept?]</p>
<p>Obtained the right? Accept?</p>
<p>‘It sounds like it’s giving me something…’</p>
<p>Growing up in poverty, he knew there was no such thing as free in life . </p>
<p>‘But I supposed that was in life .  What does any of it matter in death?’</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>As he waited in hesitation, the voice in his head asked again . </p>
<p>[You do not have much allowed time remaining .  In the case the right is refused, your heart will stop in 0 . 02 seconds .  Do you accept?]</p>
<p>Whether or not this was a hallucination, one thing was certain: his impending death . </p>
<p>On top of the sword slowly coming down on his head, the other statues’ weapons were also finding their way towards him . </p>
<p>At this point, Jinwoo gave himself up to resignation . </p>
<p>‘ . Sure, why not?’</p>
<p>He did not speak the words out loud .  Merely thought them in his head . </p>
<p>But the voice answered his thoughts . </p>
<p>[Welcome to becoming a Player . ]</p>
<p>Flash!</p>
<p>A blinding light surrounded his body, and Jinwoo lost consciousness . </p>
<p></p>
<p>-6 . Penalty-</p>
<p>He opened his eyes . </p>
<p>A bright white ceiling .  The stinging smell of disinfectant .  Feeling of a hard bed behind his back . </p>
<p>Jinwoo immediately realized where he had opened his eyes . </p>
<p>‘A hospital?’</p>
<p>Although he found himself coming less and less after meeting the B-rank Healer-class Hunter Juhee, the hospital was still a place Jinwoo could call a second home in his job .  After all, there were even rumors that there was a room reserved just for him here . </p>
<p>Jinwoo sat upright .  Holding his hand up to his chest, he felt the regular beating of his heart . </p>
<p>‘I’m . alive?’</p>
<p>Not just alive, his entire body felt lighter than usual .  Compared to the heaviness he felt when he would normally open his eyes here, something was different .  It was as if he woke up after a good rest in his own home . </p>
<p>‘ . What?’</p>
<p>When he remembered the scene before he passed out, it was an unthinkable occurrence . </p>
<p>The falling sword .  The statues that surrounded him . </p>
<p>Even if he had somehow dodged the sword, it would take a party composed of A-rank, no, S-rank Hunters to defeat the enemies in that room . </p>
<p>‘And I came out of there alive?’</p>
<p>Was it a dream?</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was an easy way to find out .  Jinwoo looked underneath the blanket covering him .  If it was all real, he would be missing a leg . </p>
<p>Then, a deep voice interrupted him, </p>
<p>“Have you regained consciousness?”</p>
