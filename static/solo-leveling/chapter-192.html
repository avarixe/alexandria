<h3>Chapter 192: Chapter 192</h3> <p>The corners of his lips bust open from that hit </p>
<p>While being forced away from the impact, Thomas Andre was reeling from the shock of the freakish power that smacked him in the face </p>
<p>‘How could… how could such a power be…?!’. </p>
<p>That punch was heavy enough for his head to shake around . But, that wasn’t all </p>
<p>That man also possessed the ability to apply physical power with nothing but his thoughts . Even then, he didn’t resist against the pulling force and willingly got himself dragged in </p>
<p>Who’d have thought of such a thing?. </p>
<p>Unexpectedly, not only did he not use his version of the ‘invisible hand’ to resist the pull, he instead used it as a distraction to divert the attention of his opponent, and then threw the real attack that couldn’t be easily avoided </p>
<p>The acceleration from the pull became the double-edged blade cutting into the one activating the ability and ended up causing even bigger damage . Now that was a shockingly well-tuned instinct for battle </p>
<p>‘Just how many fights did he go through to even come up with a tactic like that?’. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre had been looking down on Jin-Woo as some random kid even though he willingly acknowledged the Korean’s powers . But now, having been struck twice in the face, his thoughts had gone through a rapid change </p>
<p>Thomas Andre stopped bouncing away and landed back on his feet </p>
<p>Kwa-jeeeek, kwa-jeek!!. </p>
<p>The friction destroyed the cement floor below and threw up pieces of broken-off pebble and a dust cloud into the air </p>
<p>As expected, Jin-Woo didn’t give the American time to recover and dashed towards him . That was the sight of an experienced hunter . It seemed as if he had aimed for that moment before his target had regained the balance . However, his prey was the quicker of the two to react this time </p>
<p>Thomas Andre discarded all arrogant thoughts from his head . He also realised that he might lose today if he continued to fight while being considerate towards his surroundings </p>
<p>His opponent this time was far, far tougher than his initial expectation </p>
<p>“Reinforcement . ”. </p>
<p>When he muttered out those words, his body, armed with muscles that had transformed into solid armour, suddenly ballooned up explosively </p>
<p>Shu-wahck!. </p>
<p>His near two-metre-tall physique transformed into a monster over three metres tall in the blink of an eye </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaah-!!”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre roared out like an angry beast and raised both of his arms, now as thick as a marble pillar, high above his head . All of this happened way too fast!. </p>
<p>‘… !’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo, in the middle of his sprint, sensed danger up ahead </p>
<p>‘What could it be?’. </p>
<p>His brain fell into a dilemma . The thing was, not once did his instincts lie to him in moments of great peril . Jin-Woo hurriedly stopped his forward movement and almost at the same time, jumped backwards </p>
<p>With the difference of a millisecond, Thomas Andre’s massive fists pounded on the ground below </p>
<p>Kwa-kwang!!. </p>
<p>Everything caught within the radius disintegrated from the horrifying shock wave </p>
<p>His skill, ‘Demolition’ </p>
<p>That incredible might forced Jin-Woo to take several more steps backwards, even though he had already escaped to a safe zone </p>
<p>Tumble… </p>
<p>Debris flung up into the air fell down like raindrops </p>
<p>As befitting a Hunter who subjugated a Dragon, his sturdiness and destructive power were second to none . But, there was no time to remain stunned . Another loud roar exploded out from Thomas Andre’s mouth </p>
<p>“Capture!”. </p>
<p>A powerful gravitational pulling force with Thomas Andre as the centre began yanking everything within the range towards him . It was as if he had become a black hole . Shadow Soldiers and Hunters all got into a messy tangle and flew towards his position </p>
<p>Jin-Woo might have been one of the targets of this skill, ‘Capture’, but he used ‘Ruler’s Authority’ to repel away the pulling force </p>
<p>And when he finally managed to break free from that powerful force and jumped rearward one more time… </p>
<p>… . Thomas Andre’s ‘Demolition’ skill burst forth yet again </p>
<p>KWA-JEECK!!. </p>
<p>Not just the Shadow Soldiers, but even the Hunters of the Scavenger got swept away by the shock wave </p>
<p>“Uwaahk!!”. </p>
<p>“Euh, euh… . ”. </p>
<p>Screams rose up from here and there </p>
<p>The Vice-Master had discovered this horrifying situation rather late and yelled out at the top of his lungs </p>
<p>“Get away from the Master! Now!!”. </p>
<p>Three, four fleet-footed Hunters quickly retrieved their injured colleagues and escaped to the back . Meanwhile, Thomas Andre and his emotionless face viciously dashed towards Jin-Woo’s location </p>
<p>A rank of ‘Special Authority’ implied one was afforded the same level of rights as an independent nation . That was why he needed to demonstrate what the punishment for disobeying the king was like </p>
<p>Thomas Andre arrived in Jin-Woo’s location in no time at all and threw a powerful punch forward </p>
<p>Vuuoowoong-!!. </p>
<p>His fist scythed the air </p>
<p>He already knew it all too well </p>
<p>He knew better than anyone that he was too slow to land a punch on this b*stard possessing the nimbleness of a wild beast . Especially so, when he was in his reinforced state </p>
<p>His strength and defence would be enhanced to an unimaginable degree, but at the same time, his speed would drop proportionally . Fortunately enough for Thomas Andre, though, he possessed a skill that could easily cover for that drawback </p>
<p>He extended his hand out to Jin-Woo who was rapidly creating distance between them </p>
<p>‘Capture!’. </p>
<p>Once more, a powerful, incredibly attractive force activated between the two men . The American knew he’d not miss his prey now </p>
<p>With his body fortified through the ‘Reinforcement’ skill, his attention wouldn’t be stolen away from some measly diversionary tricks </p>
<p>As expected, Seong Jin-Woo was yanked back in with ease </p>
<p>Leaving his extended left hand as it was, Thomas Andre pulled his right hand back and clenched it into a tight fist . An enormous amount of magical energy, enough to smash the torso of a top-ranked Hunter apart into a gory mess, gathered into his right fist </p>
<p>Skill, ‘Power Smash’ </p>
<p>Thomas Andre’s fist, carrying a gob-smacking level of destructive power, slowly moved forward . But then, it happened </p>
<p>‘… ??’. </p>
<p>His eyes opened wider . He saw Jin-Woo’s own right arm muscles suddenly expanding greatly in size </p>
<p>‘Could he be… thinking of directly confronting me?’. </p>
<p>Finding this incredulous, Thomas Andre increased the pulling power . However, Jin-Woo didn’t try to evade it but actually used his ‘Ruler’s Authority’ to further increase his momentum, instead </p>
<p>The American cried out in shock </p>
<p>“D*mn it!”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo approached far quicker than Thomas Andre had anticipated and threw a punch a little quicker than his counterpart could . At the same time, he lowered his head and lightly evaded the American’s own belated punch </p>
<p>Kwa-boom!!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre saw a flash of light before his eyes and finally realised it </p>
<p>‘The first attack he hit me with was… . ’. </p>
<p>The attack he failed to see back then was precisely this one </p>
<p>BOOM!!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre flew away like a rocket, demolished the wall of the disused factory and rolled around on the dirt for quite some time . The deep and lengthy pit left behind on the ground by his sliding body resembled furrows on a field </p>
<p>“Keu-heuk . ”. </p>
<p>He hurriedly pushed himself off the ground, but Jin-Woo was already standing before him by then . Thomas Andre roared out and threw countless punches </p>
<p>“Uwaaaah!!”. </p>
<p>Every time his fists flew past, the ground exploded and the air was split seemingly into pieces . Each hit was ferocious enough to utterly destroy a person’s body from just a light touch </p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of those could actually touch Jin-Woo </p>
<p>He simply dodged all of Thomas Andre’s fists and accurately landed every one of his counters on the American’s vital spots </p>
<p>Kwang!! Ka-boom!! Kwahng!!. </p>
<p>Little by little, blood pooled in Thomas Andre’s mouth </p>
<p>“Keo-heok!”. </p>
<p>How could this be… . ?. </p>
<p>‘How can a Mage-type Hunter be this powerful and this fast?’. </p>
<p>The more confused he got, the greater the physical damage he suffered </p>
<p>‘Am I… Am I losing?’. </p>
<p>But, that couldn’t be happening </p>
<p>No, that must not happen </p>
<p>His ability to overwhelm his enemies with pure physical violence was the sole reason for his existence, the only thing proving that he was him and not someone else </p>
<p>Thomas Andre gritted his blood-soaked teeth . His eyes under the arched-up brows emitted a maddened glow </p>
<p>“Uwaaahh-!!”. </p>
<p>He punched with everything he had, but Jin-Woo evaded that again and smacked the American’s chin </p>
<p>Puh-geok!. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre shook his head hard to get rid of the impact force ringing in his head . But, in that brief gap, Jin-Woo had dug in until he was right below the American’s nose and attacked consecutively and without mercy </p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!!. </p>
<p>“Keo-heok!!”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre, who once resembled a towering fortress, now began faltering around </p>
<p>He unsteadily tottered about as he backed away . He somehow managed to regain his balance and cried out venomously </p>
<p>“I am none other than Thomas Andre!! You think you can bring me down with only that much?!”. </p>
<p>“That’s why I told you before . ”. </p>
<p>Kwa-boom!!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo punched Thomas Andre’s chin upwards and spoke </p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter who you are . ”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre’s head was shot up towards the sky, but he stopped it from going any further . Enraged beyond himself now, the Goliath raised his tightly interlocked fists up high above his head </p>
<p>“Demolition!!”. </p>
<p>BOOM!!. </p>
<p>The ground exploded and quaked violently as he slammed down with all his might . Too bad, Jin-Woo was no longer there </p>
<p>“Where…?!”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre’s glare hurriedly wandered around to find Jin-Woo </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>He belatedly realised that a lump of incredible magical energy was falling from above him </p>
<p>He quickly looked up </p>
<p>Jin-Woo had leapt up before the skill ‘Demolition’ was activated and now, he was descending towards his American target </p>
<p>His elbow powerfully slammed down on Thomas Andre’s face </p>
<p>KWA-BOOM!!. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Dozens of vehicles stopped almost all at once in a location fairly far away from the abandoned factory . It was decided that getting any closer would be dangerous for them </p>
<p>The folks climbing out of the vehicles were elite Hunters affiliated with the Hunter Bureau . Every single one of them was a distinguished, excellent Hunter in their own right </p>
<p>However, despite being with such great Hunters, Adam White couldn’t feel reassured at all right now . But, that was understandable when these people were being compared to Hunters Seong Jin-Woo and Thomas Andre, plus the entirety of the Scavenger Guild’s elites </p>
<p>The rank S Hunter tasked with commanding the Bureau’s own Hunter forces, a man named Brent, could only shake his head with a stiff facial expression </p>
<p>“Oh, my god… ”. </p>
<p>Just what kind of monsters were fighting right now to emit this much magical energy?. </p>
<p>His feet didn’t want to budge from the spot, but Adam White was right behind him, waiting to be guided forward with a pair of pleading eyes . Brent had no choice but to give up and spoke in a resigned voice </p>
<p>“It’s over there . However, it truly is dangerous, so my advice is, you need to be dead sure about this . ”. </p>
<p>Adam White nodded his head </p>
<p>KWA-BOOM!!. </p>
<p>It was at that moment something shot up high in the air along with a loud, explosive noise, before crashing back down to the ground </p>
<p>“… . ??”. </p>
<p>Adam White looked in the direction of that noise, before quickly shifting his gaze back to Brent . The rank S Hunter couldn’t bring himself to close shut his slack jaw </p>
<p>Adam White urgently asked him </p>
<p>“W-what was that just now?”. </p>
<p>“If, If I haven’t made a mistake, then that was… ”. </p>
<p>How could Brent, a rank S Hunter, make a mistake with his identification? Even then, he hesitated greatly before carrying on </p>
<p>“It was Mister Thomas Andre falling from the air . ”. </p>
<p>“What was that?!”. </p>
<p>“Even I can’t be sure… . ”. </p>
<p>Adam White’s eyes grew incredibly large as he hurriedly shouted out </p>
<p>“Hurry! We need to go there right now!”. </p>
<p>Brent watched Adam White run over there and gestured to other Hunters to follow them </p>
<p>The Hunter Bureau’s group soon arrived at the location where two gigantic masses of magic energy were colliding against each other . And then, they all saw it </p>
<p>“Heok . ”. </p>
<p>They saw the scene of the one and only Thomas Andre being pummelled into a rag by a lone Asian Hunter </p>
<p>Pow! Pooow! Powww!. </p>
<p>Brent freaked out and pointed at that sight </p>
<p>“T-Thomas… Mister Thomas Andre is being beaten up by Hunter Seong Jin-Woo!!”. </p>
<p>“I can also see that!”. </p>
<p>Adam White repeatedly stamped his feet on the ground in pure vexation . Even from this far, he could tell that Thomas Andre’s condition as he was getting beaten to a pulp by Jin-Woo didn’t look so good </p>
<p>Brent hurriedly asked with an expression of someone not knowing what to do </p>
<p>“What should we do now?”. </p>
<p>“We need to stop them! Are you planning to stay back and watch a Special Authority-rank Hunter get beaten to death?!”. </p>
<p>“You want us to stop that?? You mean, stop that man?!”. </p>
<p>Brent stared dumbfoundedly at the Asian Hunter emitting a truly nonsensical amount of magic power – it was so enormous, in fact, he didn’t even want to go anywhere near that maelstrom if he could help it </p>
<p>But, before he had a chance to say those words out loud, Adam White dashed forward </p>
<p>He might be a Hunter Bureau agent, but still, he was a regular person . He could lose his life simply by coming into contact with magical energy being emitted from a top-ranked Hunter </p>
<p>Brent’s expression crumpled as he weighed options, but eventually, he spat out a pained groan and chased after Adam to run towards Jin-Woo </p>
<p>“Agent White!”. </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre’s face was stomped on by the elbow and he knelt down to the ground . Both of his hands dug deep into the earth below </p>
<p>“Euh, euh… . Uwaaaah!!”. </p>
<p>He somehow managed to raise his upper torso up and continued with his attacks . Unfortunately, he had sustained too much damage to his physical body and his fists couldn’t attack with the same level of destructive force anymore </p>
<p>Jin-Woo saw those now-sluggish punches and re-confirmed the tide of battle turning towards his favour . These powerless flailing arms of Thomas Andre now only contained the losing man’s ultimately meaningless rage and desire to kill Jin-Woo </p>
<p>The Korean Hunter smoothly and easily evaded those punches and counter-attacked once more </p>
<p>Kwang!! Ka-boom!!. </p>
<p>Unlike Thomas Andre’s attacks, Jin-Woo’s hits constantly raining down aimed precisely at the American’s vital spots and as a result, the poor man couldn’t even regain his wits anymore </p>
<p>“Keo-heok!”. </p>
<p>Every time Thomas Andre’s head snapped in one direction or to the other side, blood spat out from his face . He lost his balance and tottered around unsteadily . Jin-Woo remained merciless as he kicked the American man </p>
<p>Ka-boom!!. </p>
<p>“Keok!”. </p>
<p>The colliding magic energy exploded and Thomas Andre’s body rocketed up into the sky </p>
<p>‘Ruler’s Authority . ’. </p>
<p>He yanked at the American man flying up endlessly into the air, causing his victim to crash-land back down to Earth with no resistance whatsoever </p>
<p>BOOM-!!. </p>
<p>“Cough!”. </p>
<p>Thomas Andre lay sprawled on the ground and vomited out a mouthful of blood . Jin-Woo mounted on top of him </p>
<p>And just like when he was fighting against the demon king Baran back in the Demon’s Castle, he grasped Thomas Andre’s neck and slammed down with his other fist </p>
<p>Pow! Slam!! Boom!. </p>
<p>He could sense Thomas Andre’s resistance weaken gradually </p>
<p>Pow! Boom! Pow!. </p>
<p>And finally – just as Jin-Woo raised his fist high up to land the finisher, he heard a certain someone’s desperate cry </p>
<p>“Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim! Please, stop! I beg you, stay your hand, please!”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo disinterestedly stared at Adam White running towards him before clenching his fist tightly again . A horrifying amount of magical energy roiled around his greatly-expanded shoulder muscles and his fist </p>
<p>“N-no! Stop!”. </p>
<p>Just before the fist could slam down on the target…. </p>
<p>As Adam White cried out, his hand reaching out in desperation…. </p>
<p>… . Thomas Andre finally opened his mouth </p>
<p>“… . I lost . ”. </p>
<p>Whoosh-!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s fist stopped millimetres away from the American’s nose </p>
<p>As if he had used up all of his energy just to surrender, Thomas Andre lost his consciousness right afterwards and went limp </p>
<p>Only then did Jin-Woo withdraw his fist and wordlessly got back up </p>
<p>Soon afterwards, Hunters affiliated with the Bureau cautiously filed in around him and Thomas Andre on the ground </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>“What the f*ck… What the hell is this? Did this really happen? Seriously?!”. </p>
<p>A certain reporter was muttering to himself as he continuously snapped one photo after another </p>
<p>Originally, he planned to snap a few shots of the Scavenger Guild Hunters getting ready for a raid . But now…. </p>
<p>All he did was to simply follow after the Hunters who inexplicably cancelled the raid and began moving to somewhere . So, how on earth could he explain this?. </p>
<p>The reporter initially thought that there was a dungeon break happening somewhere . But the spectacle unfolding before his eyes easily exceeded his wildest imaginations </p>
<p>He used the zoom function to confirm the face of the man lying sprawled on the ground once more time </p>
<p>That was a rather familiar face, that’s for sure </p>
<p>Without a doubt, that face belonged to the Special Authority-rank Hunter, Thomas Andre </p>
<p>‘Oh, my god… . Just who can beat Thomas Andre up like that?!’. </p>
<p>The reporter spat out a shocked gasp as he scrolled through the images he had taken so far </p>
<p>And at the same time, his heart trembled in excitement after realising that the photos contained within this little camera would net him a huge wad of cash </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 192 &gt; Fin </p>
