<h3>Chapter 196: Chapter 196</h3> <p>“What you said in there – were you being serious?”. </p>
<p>Adam White, waiting outside the conference hall, threw that question out </p>
<p>Even though Jin-Woo wanted to ask back, “What are you talking about?” he said only one thing inside the conference hall, didn’t he?. </p>
<p>So, he simply grinned as his reply </p>
<p>“Yup . ”. </p>
<p>“Haha… . ”. </p>
<p>Although this was no time to laugh, Adam White ended up chuckling after seeing Jin-Woo’s grin, anyway </p>
<p>Just who were the folks inside the conference hall?. </p>
<p>They were 500 or so of the top-ranked Hunters from around 120 countries, who were invited by the Hunter Bureau to attend this conference . In other words, they were the top elites humanity had to offer </p>
<p>But then, this man went and said to them, ‘Even if it means every Hunter in the world becomes my enemy’ </p>
<p>Any ol’ tough guy wouldn’t even dare to imitate what Jin-Woo had done . What’s more surprising was the fact that not one person ridiculed him for making that claim </p>
<p>Even Liu Zhigeng, renowned for his vicious personality, simply kept silent and stared at Hunter Seong Jin-Woo . He made no complaints whatsoever towards the Korean’s declaration </p>
<p>Not just the Hunters inside the conference hall, but even the agents watching the proceedings through various monitors couldn’t shut their agape mouths . Adam White was among those agents, obviously </p>
<p>He sighed in admiration and spoke up </p>
<p>“Most likely, there should be only two people in this whole wide world, including you, who could say something like that in there, Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo became slightly curious about who the other guy might be </p>
<p>“Who is this other person… . ?”. </p>
<p>“Well, he’s in the hospital right now . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo saw Adam White’s wry smile and immediately realised who that mystery ‘other guy’ could be . It could only be Thomas Andre </p>
<p>For sure, that guy would do something just as crazy, what with that arrogant personality of his </p>
<p>‘But, it’s unknown whether he’ll still behave that way or not . ’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo recalled the last expression Thomas Andre made as he admitted to his defeat, and formed his own wry smile </p>
<p>In the meantime, Adam White quickly explained the itinerary for the rest of the day </p>
<p>“A dinner party has been scheduled to take place this evening . Since we at the Bureau went all out to prepare this grand feast, how about sharing a cordial meal with other Hunters if you don’t have anything urgent to… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo shook his head right away </p>
<p>“I’m planning to stop by at a hospital . ”. </p>
<p>“Excuse me?”. </p>
<p>Adam White’s brows shot up </p>
<p>Did he get injured somewhere last night? No, hang on . Maybe that was an inevitable result . The Special Authority-rank Hunter Thomas Andre suffered such grievous wounds that he still couldn’t recover properly after receiving concentrated healing from several top-class Healers . That attested to how violent and fierce the fight was </p>
<p>So, even if it was Hunter Seong Jin-Woo, he must have suffered one or two injuries… </p>
<p>“I’m worried about Yu Jin-Ho, you see . ”. </p>
<p>“Oh… . ”. </p>
<p>So, he was talking about ‘that’ </p>
<p>Having realised that it was unnecessary to worry about Jin-Woo, even for a little bit, Adam White could only reflect on his hastiness in silence . Still, he couldn’t let go and asked one more time, just in case </p>
<p>“Uh, maybe your shoulder or wrists have been aching since last night… . ?”. </p>
<p>“Pardon?”. </p>
<p>“Ah, no . It’s nothing…”. </p>
<p>While Adam White was getting more flustered than ever before…. </p>
<p>… . Hunters that had been gathered in small groups of two and three to chat among themselves suddenly parted ways and stood to either side of the hallway . Naturally, both Jin-Woo’s and Adam White’s attention shifted over there, as well </p>
<p>And that’s where they spotted Liu Zhigeng </p>
<p>China’s Seven Star-rank Hunter was flanked by the ‘Liu Zhigeng Squadron’ – made up entirely of his direct subordinates – as he made his way towards Jin-Woo </p>
<p>As if he already had a destination in mind a long time ago, the Chinese Hunter walked in a straight line until he was standing right before Jin-Woo’s nose </p>
<p>‘Heok…!’. </p>
<p>‘W-what are those two up to now?’. </p>
<p>Hunters all stopped talking right there and then </p>
<p>The taut tension flowing between Jin-Woo and Liu Zhigeng managed to utterly silence the surroundings . The palpable feeling of unease rapidly filled this place up </p>
<p>Hunters hurriedly looked around in anxiety </p>
<p>‘Why is Liu Zhigeng behaving that way?’. </p>
<p>‘Is it because of what Hunter Seong Jin-Woo said back in there?’. </p>
<p>‘Yup, I was wondering why he was keeping quiet back then… . ’. </p>
<p>Without a doubt, what Jin-Woo said could be interpreted as a provocation towards other Hunters . And the person who asked him the question even happened to be none other than Liu Zhigeng </p>
<p>First, it was Thomas Andre . And now, it was the turn of Liu Zhigeng?. </p>
<p>Hunters paid close attention to the changing expressions of these two men, as even more anxiety clouded their own faces, wondering what would happen next </p>
<p>In the meantime, Adam White found himself stuck between these two titans by sheer bad luck and his own expression paled almost instantly </p>
<p>“E-excuse me, Hunters… . ”. </p>
<p>Before he could finish saying something, Liu Zhigeng took another step forward and opened his mouth first . His weighty voice flowed out next . Jin-Woo listened to him and a sombre expression gradually formed on his face </p>
<p>‘…… . What on earth is he saying? I can’t understand a single word . ’. </p>
<p>He had never even gone anywhere remotely close to China before, so there was no way he’d know a lick of Chinese </p>
<p>Since the other guy was speaking in a serious expression, he too decided to form a similarly serious one, but as it turned out, listening to words he couldn’t understand proved to be a rather uncomfortable and arduous task </p>
<p>Just as he began thinking that the Chinese Hunter probably wasn’t making fun of him with such a grave expression on his face, Adam White whispered something in his ear </p>
<p>“He’s saying that he hunted down the Giant monster you missed during your trip to Japan on the Chinese coast recently, Seong Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>A look of surprise spread all over Jin-Woo’s face </p>
<p>“You even know Chinese?”. </p>
<p>“Well, I was in charge of the Asia branch, after all . I can speak a few Asian languages . Ah, also, I can speak a little bit of Russian, Spanish, Arabic, as well as German… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo very briefly thought that it’d become a whole lot more convenient for him if Agent Adam White became one of his Shadow Soldiers . Of course, he quickly admonished himself for even entertaining such a thought </p>
<p>Maybe he still had lots more things to say? Liu Zhigeng continued on with his words in the meantime </p>
<p>“Please, keep translating for me . ”. </p>
<p>“Alright . ”. </p>
<p>Adam White nodded his head and, with a determined expression, began his temporary role as an interpreter </p>
<p>“He says that he got surprised from how unexpectedly strong the Giant monster was . And he also says that it was a difficult battle as he had to fight the monster on the ocean’s surface . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo remembered being surprised himself by the strength of those Giant monsters, back when he was hunting them down . They had such huge bodies yet they also moved around nimbly like wild beasts, too </p>
<p>Since Liu Zhigeng said he fought the monster over the water, which imposed a greater restriction on one’s movements, his surprise should have been greater when compared to fighting the creature on dry land </p>
<p>As a fellow Hunter, Jin-Woo could pretty much understand where the Chinese man’s fluster stemmed from </p>
<p>The longer Liu Zhigeng’s words got, the brighter Adam White’s expression became </p>
<p>“Ever since that encounter, he says, he’s been meaning to meet you . He has been really curious to learn more about the person capable of easily hunting down all those powerful monsters . That’s what he said . ”. </p>
<p>In the same breath that Adam White finished translating, Liu Zhigeng formed a bright smile and reached his hand out for a shake </p>
<p>It seemed that the previous serious expression came from his nervousness </p>
<p>Jin-Woo looked at that offered hand for a bit, before shaking it with a smile of his own . He had absolutely no reason to refuse a greeting offered up first by one of the best Hunters in the world </p>
<p>Adam White had figured out what was going on here and could finally breathe a sigh of relief </p>
<p>“Whew… . ”. </p>
<p>Forming a bond between fellow Hunters – this encounter certainly stayed true to the original intention of the International Guild Conference </p>
<p>As they shook hands, Liu Zhigeng said some other things with a smile . Jin-Woo looked at Adam White again </p>
<p>“Sounds like he’s making a joke, so what is he saying?”. </p>
<p>“Ah…”. </p>
<p>Adam White briefly formed a lost expression, before the corners of his lips arched up </p>
<p>“He says that he’s really happy about you teaching Thomas Andre Hunter-nim a lesson . He doesn’t even have to take a look to know that it was Thomas who instigated the whole thing first… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo grinned at that one </p>
<p>The Chinese Hunter initially came across as an irritable and rude uncle, but he turned out to be a rather interesting person . Now that the greeting was over, their hands parted ways </p>
<p>But then, Liu Zhigeng’s complexion darkened somewhat </p>
<p>Likewise, the smile on Adam White’s face was wiped off as well . He quickly translated what the Chinese Hunter was saying </p>
<p>“That is why he will now pray even harder that ‘Suspect S’ isn’t actually your family member . He says that he doesn’t want to fight against you, no matter what . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo wordlessly nodded his head </p>
<p>“Both of you are here . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo and Liu Zhigeng shifted their gazes in the direction of that voice . Although they felt this person’s presence, they knew he wasn’t a Hunter since he didn’t emit any magic energy </p>
<p>Sure enough, that voice belonged to the Hunter Bureau’s Director . He alternated his gaze between Jin-Woo and Liu Zhigeng before asking both men . He sounded rather tense as he did so for some reason </p>
<p>“Can both of you clear some time in your schedule, please?”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo looked at Adam White for confirmation, but the latter man shook his head . Meaning, this wasn’t in their itinerary </p>
<p>What did he want from them, then?. </p>
<p>Before making his reply, Jin-Woo pushed his Perception Stat to the extreme first and analysed the movements of every single Hunter within the conference venue </p>
<p>‘Two people with a huge concentration of magical energy… . ’. </p>
<p>Two very powerful Hunters were heading towards the same destination under the guidance of several escorts . Seeing that both he and Liu Zhigeng had been called upon like this, that event couldn’t be chalked up to being a coincidence </p>
<p>‘Did something happen somewhere?’. </p>
<p>When Jin-Woo looked as if he was hesitating somewhat, Adam White remembered something and quickly answered for him </p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right . Sir, Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim said earlier that he’d go visit Yu Jin-Ho Hunter-nim at the hospital… . ”. </p>
<p>However, Jin-Woo placed his hand on the American agent’s shoulder to stop him . When their gazes met, he shook his head before turning around to face the director </p>
<p>“Alright, I will . ”. </p>
<p>The director’s expression brightened immediately and he looked at Liu Zhigeng next </p>
<p>“How about you, Hunter Liu Zhigeng?”. </p>
<p>“I’m in . ”. </p>
<p>“Very good . In that case, please, follow me . ”. </p>
<p>The director’s expression was as bright as a salaryman who managed to pull off a difficult negotiation . He then took the lead and guided the two Hunters away </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Funnily enough, the destinations for the two were not the same </p>
<p>Liu Zhigeng was guided by other agents and went down the corridor on the left, while Jin-Woo followed the director and continued down their original path </p>
<p>‘Isn’t this strange… . ?’. </p>
<p>With the addition of Liu Zhigeng to the ranks of those two powerful Hunters he sensed earlier, three beings with rather enormous magic energy had gathered in one spot now </p>
<p>Jin-Woo thought he’d be escorted to that place as well, but seeing that he was being led to a different destination altogether, he began cooking up several likely reasons for this . He gave up in the end, though, and asked the director </p>
<p>“Why am I the only one going to the different room?”. </p>
<p>“Ah… . ”. </p>
<p>The director pondered his answer for a little bit before deciding to delay it altogether </p>
<p>“There is someone waiting for you, actually . She will explain everything to you once we get there . ”. </p>
<p>“… . ”. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Jin-Woo could sense a certain person’s aura coming from a room located at the end of this corridor </p>
<p>‘Uh? Doesn’t this magic energy belong to that… . ?’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s eyes grew wider since the person waiting for him was someone he didn’t expect to see here . As a matter of fact, he never thought they would meet each other again any time soon </p>
<p>“Looks like you have figured out who she is . ”. </p>
<p>He must’ve been feeling really nervous because cold sweat drops were visibly forming on the director’s forehead </p>
<p>“We do our best to not to expose her location if we can help it . But then, this issue being what it is, we didn’t have much of a choice… . ”. </p>
<p>“Does that mean the Hunter Bureau demanded her to come?”. </p>
<p>“No, not at all . It was she that demanded to be here . She specifically wishes to meet you . ”. </p>
<p>Clunk… </p>
<p>The director opened the door to the room and Jin-Woo got to meet the gaze of a certain African-American woman waiting patiently for him there </p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . ”. </p>
<p>“Likewise, Madam Selner . ”. </p>
<p>It was none other than the ‘Upgrader’, Norma Selner, the Awakened possessing a unique ability </p>
<p>He wondered if she had calmed down now that a bit of time had passed since their last encounter, but unfortunately, the light shining in her eyes was the same as before . She still looked quite terrified of him </p>
<p>He definitely sensed her strong fear of him from the way she stared at him . Despite that, she wanted to meet him for some reason . Just what could make her move in spite of her fears? Jin-Woo’s curiosity had definitely been stoked now </p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to seek me out first, ma’am, so… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo settled down on the seat opposite hers . Adam White, once more assigned as an interpreter, stuck close to Jin-Woo’s side </p>
<p>Madam Selner politely bowed her head </p>
<p>“I’d like to apologise for that day . Back then, my mind wasn’t in the right place to… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo raised his hands and stopped her </p>
<p>He wasn’t planning to talk about back then just so he could hear her apologise . She sneaked a glance at the director, only to see him nod his head with a hardened expression </p>
<p>Madam Selner hesitated greatly before her lips parted with some difficulty </p>
<p>“I’ve been having the exact same dream every day . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was not confident about reading people’s dreams . And even he could tell that they didn’t ask for him to be here for that purpose, either . Still, he asked her so he could get some clarification on the topic </p>
<p>“What kind of a dream was it?”. </p>
<p>“In my dream, I watch the scenes of top Hunters being hunted down by a group of unknown people . ”. </p>
<p>A group of unknown people hunting down powerful Hunters, she said . Almost immediately, Jin-Woo realised that this matter had to be related to him in some capacity </p>
<p>“And a few days later, that dream becomes reality . ”. </p>
<p>“Could you be talking about… Christopher Reid?”. </p>
<p>Madam Selner nodded her head </p>
<p>The director took over the explanation from there on </p>
<p>“We had warned Mister Reid ahead of time, but he wasn’t interested in hearing us out . The end result was… well, you know what happened already . ”. </p>
<p>Indeed, Jin-Woo had seen and heard enough of Christopher Reid’s fate </p>
<p>Madam Selner continued on with a trembling voice </p>
<p>“Powerful Hunters supporting this world will continue to die . Those hunting the Hunters will not stop what they are doing . ”. </p>
<p>“So, what you’re saying is… . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo collected his thoughts and cautiously opened his mouth </p>
<p>“… . You also wish to warn me of the dangers… . ?”. </p>
<p>“No, that’s not it . ”. </p>
<p>She resolutely shook her head </p>
<p>If she didn’t want to warn him, what did she want then? Jin-Woo looked at her with a puzzled expression . Madam Selner then spoke with desperately-pleading tone of voice </p>
<p>“Please, I beg of you . Protect these Hunters . ”. </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 196 &gt; Fin </p>
