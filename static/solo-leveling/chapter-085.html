<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 85</p>
<p>An E-rank Hunter volunteered to go into an A-rank Dungeon?!</p>
<p>It indeed stirred a commotion amongst the Hunters . </p>
<p>“The high-level magic beasts are waiting in there!”</p>
<p>“Sung-ssi, what are you thinking?!”</p>
<p>“You’re still young, don’t throw away your life for some money!”</p>
<p>The members of the mining team swarmed him, trying to change his mind .  Team Leader Bae explained to Son Gihoon,</p>
<p>“Oh no, that fellow just started working here . He must’ve raised his hand without knowing anything . ”</p>
<p>“What is his rank?”</p>
<p>. <strong>“That’s…”</strong>. </p>
<p>The team leader glanced at Jinwoo and whispered,</p>
<p>“He’s an E-ranker . His rank is too low, why don’t you take someone else? Taking that fellow is too dangerous . ”</p>
<p>Son Gihoon’s expression became serious . </p>
<p>‘That man… is an E-ranker?’</p>
<p>The man who had met his eyes earlier .  Certainly, the A-ranker did not detect any strong magic power coming from him .  But what was it? The man had . an unexplainable and dangerous aura about him . </p>
<p>‘He didn’t feel like an E-ranker . ’</p>
<p>In any glance, he did not look like the lowest-ranking Hunter .  Of course, Son Gihoon didn’t think that Team Leader Bae was lying, but he could not shake his instinct . </p>
<p>‘Still, the porter’s rank doesn’t matter . ’</p>
<p>All the porter had to do was carry the baggage .  If the porter placed at the rear of the raiding party was in danger, the Raid would’ve already failed .  If it got to a situation where an A-ranker’s life was in danger, what did it matter if the porter was C-rank or E-rank? They’ll all die just the same .  However, Son Gihoon could not think beyond that . The time was running out . He looked at Jinwoo and spoke,</p>
<p>“No, we’ll take that man . ”</p>
<p>“Is it too heavy?”</p>
<p>Son Gihoon asked .  Jinwoo shook his head,</p>
<p>“I’m alright . ”</p>
<p>The bag on the E-ranker’s back contained the raiding party’s clothes, weapons and defensive gears .  The size was quite large, but to Jinwoo, it did not feel heavy at all . It was the power of his Strength stat . </p>
<p>‘He doesn’t look like he’s struggling . ’</p>
<p>Son Gihoon looked over Jinwoo’s expression then turned towards the Gate .  Jinwoo also turned his head . In front of them, a Gate as large as yesterday’s floated in the air . </p>
<p>‘Wait, is this one bigger?’</p>
<p>However, they said the magic power seeping out today’s Gate was smaller than yesterday’s .  Since the Raid’s difficulty was determined by the magic power and not the size of the Gate, the secondary raiding party was deployed here . </p>
<p>‘Huh… the magic power coming out is pitiful compared to yesterday’s . ’</p>
<p>In front of the Gate, Jinwoo was assured .  It seemed that the Association’s measurements were not off . </p>
<p>But what was this feeling? Just like in front of the Red Gate, the E-rank Hunter felt a strange sense of dread . </p>
<p>‘ . I’m just imagining it, right?’</p>
<p>Son Gihoon gave the order,</p>
<p>“Let us go . ”</p>
<p>The members of the raiding party that had been waiting near the Gate all started to move as one .  One by one, the Hunters entered the Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Watching them, Jinwoo followed behind . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You have entered the Dungeon . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The insides were rather plain .  Having entered with his nerves on edge, Jinwoo relaxed once he came across a tunnel far smaller than yesterday’s . </p>
<p>‘Phew-’</p>
<p>Thankfully, they were not transported to another world .  Well, the composition of the party might be able to clear a Red Gate . </p>
<p>11 A-rankers and 6 B-rankers . </p>
<p>Like Team Leader Bae said, in any other Guild, this party would have never been the secondary raiding party .  Jinwoo smiled,</p>
<p>‘I’m not even part of the raiding party, let’s relax . ’</p>
<p>Yesterday and today .  In a way, he was just here to play around .  Only difference today was that he would be able to witness more things .  There was no need to be on edge . With that in mind, his heart relaxed a bit . </p>
<p>“Don’t be so nervous . ”</p>
<p>From his side, a female Healer-class Hunter struck up a conversation .  She looked like she was in her late 20s? It seemed that she had noticed his hardened expression and wanted to cheer him up a bit . </p>
<p>“Gihoon oppa, I mean, the Raid Leader and everyone here are experienced Hunters . Well, except for me . ”</p>
<p>A brightly smiling Healer .  From the start, there was nothing like fear in Jinwoo’s heart, but at her carefree expression, his sharpened nerves emptied from his heart like someone popped a balloon with a needle .  Jinwoo held back a laughter and nodded,</p>
<p>“Ah, okay . ”</p>
<p>As if satisfied by her work, the Healer put on a proud expression . </p>
<p>Meanwhile, having confirmed that there were no magic beasts near the entrance, a signal was given to move forward . </p>
<p>“Let’s move . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo and the Healer matched the pace of the raiding party and walked slowly .  Because they were taking care of their surroundings, the movement of the party was slow . </p>
<p>“If it’s heavy, could I help out a bit?”</p>
<p>The Healer asked after glancing at the baggage Jinwoo was carrying .  Without a word, he held out a water tank in his left hand . The woman took it and immediately faltered at its weight . </p>
<p>“Ahhh!!!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly grabbed the water tank from the Healer who was about to lose her balance .  The entire party halted and stared at the Healer . </p>
<p>“I’m sorry . I’m sorry . ”</p>
<p>The Healer bowed her head left and right .  Of course, she did not offer to help again .  Instead, she glared at him every once in a while .  Jinwoo swallowed a laughter and feigned ignorance . It’s been a long time since he felt like laughing in a Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘It’s dangerous to get distracted . ’</p>
<p>Especially in his recent Raids .  When he thought back on the difficulty of the Demon Castle, he shuddered .  However, today was different . It felt nice to tag along as a nobody in a Raid like this . </p>
<p>Suddenly, Jinwoo stopped .  Noticing what the E-ranker noticed a beat later than he did, the raiding party also stopped . </p>
<p>“Here they come!”</p>
<p>Before even Son Gihoon finished giving the order, the entire party got into defensive positions .  It was in a blink of an eye . Jinwoo was amazed,</p>
<p>‘So this is the Raid of high-ranking Hunters…’</p>
<p>It was in a completely different level than the raiding parties he had seen in the past .  Even the naive-looking female Healer also was in a utmost ready stance, a clear light coming from her hands . </p>
<p>‘Looks like I won’t have a chance to step up . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo rid himself of the worry and at the same time was disappointed . </p>
<p>Anyways, the magic beasts arrived . </p>
<p>Beast? Dog?</p>
<p>Son Gihoon’s eyes narrowed . </p>
<p>da da da da da da da da</p>
<p>A group of magic beasts that looked like hyenas ran towards the group .  Each of them was a size of a midsize car . Son Gihoon tilted his head,</p>
<p>‘Dungeon Jackals?’</p>
<p>As they neared, he became sure .  They were Dungeon Jackals . Son Gihoon relaxed his tensed form that held out a shield .  The man slammed his shield down on a Dungeon Jackal that leaped toward his neck . </p>
<p>whimper!</p>
<p>“The hell?”</p>
<p>“Dungeon Jackals?”</p>
<p>The members of the party that had been maintaining a tense stance also relaxed and tilted their heads .  Soon, the cry of Dungeon Jackals filled the cave . </p>
<p>whimper!</p>
<p>yelp!</p>
<p>whimp-</p>
<p>The magic beasts were routed in no time .  The dozen or so jackals were quickly turned to corpses .  The Hunters dusted off their hands in confusion . </p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t even have time to finish casting my spell . ”</p>
<p>“Why would Dungeon Jackals come out of an A-rank Dungeon?”</p>
<p>“Right?”</p>
<p>“Did the Association fuck up again?”</p>
<p>Their voices were raised .  It was a cardinal rule in Dungeons not to raise your voice .  The appearance of the Dungeon Jackals were shocking enough to make the Hunters forget that rule . </p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Son Gihoon looked over the jackals’ corpses and scratched his temple . </p>
<p>‘Why would magic beasts from a C-rank Dungeon come out here?’</p>
<p>The Tanker looked around in disbelief .  Everyone had similar expressions . Except one man . </p>
<p>Jinwoo was looking at the corpses of the jackals with an uneasy expression . </p>
<p>‘They’re not normal jackals . ’</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed .  He looked over the traces of matted furs around the jackals’ necks .  It was evidence that they were tied up somewhere . </p>
<p>‘That means there’s something else here that raised these things…’</p>
<p>Magic beasts with intelligence .  Jinwoo recalled the White Walkers from the Red Gate .  No matter what race they belonged to, magic beasts with intelligence were a difficult enemy . </p>
<p>‘That feeling I had… might be right after all . ’</p>
<p>It was not a good omen . </p>
<p>“What are you looking at so seriously?”</p>
<p>The female Healer came up to him and stared blankly at the corpse . </p>
<p>“Shh!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo held up a finger . </p>
<p>step step</p>
<p>step step</p>
<p>He heard footsteps coming this way from deeper into the cave . </p>
<p>‘The real thing is coming . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo got up .  Meanwhile, the other Hunters also realized something was wrong . </p>
<p>“Oh my god…”</p>
<p>“P-prepare for battle!”</p>
<p>Son Gihoon squeezed out an order .  Finally, from the darkness of the cave, the real enemy appeared .  The eyes of the Hunters widened . </p>
<p>“High orcs?”</p>
<p>“Of all the magic beasts, why high orcs?!”</p>
<p>The high orc warriors that looked battle-hardened were standing in a formation .  There was 22 of them . Even if it was just normal high orcs, 22 of them would’ve been a difficult enemy .  But these were high orc warriors . </p>
<p>“Something… something went wrong . ”</p>
<p>. <strong>Someone uttered .  To think that the low-level magic beasts would be followed by high-level magic beasts that were known for their strength among the high-level magic beasts . </strong>. </p>
<p>Clack! Clack!</p>
<p>The long spears of the high orcs pointed towards the Hunters . </p>
<p>‘The Hunters and the high orcs are about evenly matched . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo evacuated to a corner .  He planned to quietly observe the situation and look for the timing where he had to step up .  The female Healer mistook his intentions,</p>
<p>“Stay there and hide so you don’t get hurt!”</p>
<p>For some reason… that was a bit infuriating .  Jinwoo closed his eyes and took deep breaths to try and calm his anger .  </p>
<p>Soon, the battle began . </p>
<p>“Kuaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>At the approaching high orcs, Son Gihoon used a wide area taunting skill .  However, the high orcs were not so easily provoked . Soon, the Fighter-class Hunters and the high orcs clashed . </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>crack!</p>
<p>Blood spilled everywhere, followed by screams . </p>
<p>“Euaaaak!”</p>
<p>The completed spells of the Mage-class Hunters fell upon the high orcs . </p>
<p>Bang! Boom!</p>
<p>The high orcs struck by ‘Arrow of Light’ lost their heads .  However, the spells did not shoot out repeatedly . While the magic’s effects were strong, it had a drawback of having casting times . </p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>The high orcs were starting to win the melee . </p>
<p>“Heal! Heal!”</p>
<p>“H-hurry!”</p>
<p>The number of injured increased, and the Healers became busy . </p>
<p>“H-healer-nim!”</p>
<p>The female Healer was also running left and right . </p>
<p>“I’m on my way! I’m on my way!”</p>
<p>She knelt down next to a Hunter that had lost an arm and uttered incantations . </p>
<p>wooooong-</p>
<p>With a bright light, the Hunter’s arm began to regenerate .  It was the power of healing afforded by an A-rank Healer’s powers .  But while she was focused on her patient, a large shadow fell over her .  The Healer raised her head . A high orc that she had thought was dead was standing over her with an axe in hand . </p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>The Healer’s face turned white .  Unfortunately, there were no allies nearby .  When the orc raised its axe, instead of running away, the Healer covered her patient with her body . </p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>She held her head down, waiting for the blow to come .  However, no matter how long she waited, she did not feel any pain .  In a moment where a single second felt like a minute, the Healer raised her head slightly .  An incredible sight was before her . </p>
<p>“Ku . Kwek…”</p>
<p>The high orc was floating in the air, flailing its limbs . </p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>What was happening? The Healer opened her eyes wide . </p>
<p>Suddenly,</p>
<p>cruuuunch</p>
<p>The high orc’s head separated from its body, pulling up its spine with it .  It was an incredible display of power . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>Looking at the high orc’s body that collapsed to the ground, the Healer looked completely dumbfounded . </p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>The high orc’s head was still floating in the air . </p>
<p>‘ . Bleh, I got blood on me . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo scrunched his face and threw the high orc’s head . </p>
<p>SMACK!</p>
<p>Another high orc was struck by his comrade’s head and fell to the ground .  Its neck twisted in a grotesque way, it was not going to be getting up anytime soon . </p>
<p>‘Two down . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his gaze .  He was currently in ‘Stealth’ .  Neither the high orcs nor the Hunters could see him in this state . </p>
<p>The man had worried about stepping up and getting scolded by the Hunters, but then found a solution in his ‘Stealth’ skill .  With this, he would be able to do whatever he wanted . The corners of his mouth rose . </p>
<p>‘Shall I get started?’</p>
<p>In that moment,</p>
<p>“Uwaaah!”</p>
<p>He saw the Raid Leader, Son Gihoon, fighting with three high orcs at once . </p>
<p>Jinwoo’s legs moved with incredible speed . </p>
