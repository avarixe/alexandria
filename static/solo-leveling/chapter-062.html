<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 62</p>
<p>The Shadow Soldiers quickly closed the gap!</p>
<p>However, the ferocious movements of the ice bears were far faster than the Shadow Soldiers . </p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>A single swipe of the bear’s claw obliterated a Shadow Soldier .  If it was a human in that pitch black armor and not a shadow, it would’ve been a gruesome sight . </p>
<p>‘Hmm…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo furrowed his brows . </p>
<p>‘As I thought, was it too much?’</p>
<p>Whether it was strength or size, it unfortunately looked like it was too much for Shadow Soldiers to face the ice bears . </p>
<p>But suddenly, something surprising happened . </p>
<p>‘What the!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>The body of the Shadow Soldier that was destroyed by an ice bear turned to black smoke before it fully hit the ground . </p>
<p>shooooo-</p>
<p>The black smoke gathered at some distance away, then reformed into its original shape . </p>
<p>‘Oh shit!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s face lit up . </p>
<p>Undead . </p>
<p>He had forgotten about the true nature of these shadows and was now reminded . </p>
<p>Realizing its attack had no effect, the ice bear panicked and roared . </p>
<p>Roooaaaar!</p>
<p>While the Shadow Infantry kept the ice bears busy, the Shadow Mages had finished their casting . </p>
<p>Flaaaare-!</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Kaboom!</p>
<p>The fireballs released from the mages’ hands exploded here and there .  While the Shadow Infantry caught by the explosion regenerated immediately, the ice bears caught on fire and thrashed about . </p>
<p>“Kuwaaaah!”</p>
<p>“Kuwuuh!”</p>
<p>The Shadow Infantry continued their attacks, swinging and stabbing their swords at the burning bears . </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>At first, the ice bears looked like they had the advantage, but they were slowly being pushed back by the combined attack of the infantry and the mages . </p>
<p>‘Whoa…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo watched the battle with great interest . </p>
<p>The infantry’s fast regeneration . </p>
<p>The mage’s powerful firepower . </p>
<p>The might of Shadow Soldiers exceeded his expectations .  The ice bears were soon overwhelmed and were pushed all the way back to the caves .  It seemed like the battle was over-</p>
<p>ROOOOAAAAR!</p>
<p>With a roar that shook the eardrums, something giant appeared from the cave . </p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened .  It was an ice bear a head taller than the rest and also much wider . </p>
<p>ROAR!</p>
<p>At a single swipe of its claw, many Shadow Soldiers were swept away . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>Craaaaack!</p>
<p>Even their quick regeneration speed could not keep up . </p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Smash!</p>
<p>“Looks like the alpha made his appearance…”</p>
<p>Of course, he had expected that a den of bears would have an alpha bear .  But the thing’s size and power surpassed his expectations . </p>
<p>ROOOOAR!</p>
<p>The giant ice bear slapped away the Shadow Soldiers and ran toward Jinwoo .  Suddenly, a message appeared,</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You are out of mana . The Shadow Soldiers cannot regenerate . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You are out of mana . The Shadow Soldiers cannot regenerate . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>What?</p>
<p>He checked his mana in panic .  Just as the System said, his mana was at zero . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>MP: 0 / 1,860</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>With his mana gone, the Shadow Soldiers no longer regenerated after being destroyed .  Instead, they turned into shadow and returned to Jinwoo’s shadow . Jinwoo realized that it was his mana that allowed the soldiers to regenerate . </p>
<p>‘That goddamn mana…’</p>
<p>He found yet another reason to raise his intelligence stat .  Jinwoo scratched the side of his head . The appearance of the alpha had completely turned the tide of the battle .  However, Jinwoo still had a trump card up his sleeve . </p>
<p>‘If their boss came out, I should send mine out as well . ’</p>
<p>With his arms crossed, Jinwoo called for the one who was worthy to be called the Shadow Soldier’s boss . </p>
<p>“Ygritte!”</p>
<p>A single shadow slid out from Jinwoo’s shadow .  From the shadow rose a knight wearing a helmet adorned with a plumage .  Jinwoo raised a chin at the alpha . Ygritte bowed his head to Jinwoo then shot forth towards the giant ice bear . </p>
<p>step, step, step, step!</p>
<p>Ygritte dodged the alpha’s swipe and slid between the ice bear’s legs .  While in motion, he quickly took out the daggers at his side and cut the tendons of the beast’s legs . </p>
<p>“Kuwwaaah!”</p>
<p>This was only the beginning . </p>
<p>Unsheathing his long sword, Ygritte skillfully dodged the torrent of attacks from the alpha while carving it up like a sculpture . </p>
<p>Tendons, claws, paws, legs .  Bit by bit, the alpha’s flesh was being cut off like being worked by a butcher .  </p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo watched Ygritte’s flowing, artlike movements with great admiration . </p>
<p>The head was the last to go . </p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>The giant ice bear’s head was cleanly separated from its body .  Before it could hit the ground, Ygritte snatched it from the air .  The knight approached Jinwoo then knelt before the Hunter . </p>
<p>drop</p>
<p>Ygritte placed the bear’s head in front of Jinwoo feet, as if offering a trophy to his king .  Jinwoo stared at the knight and gulped,</p>
<p>‘If he used his sword from the start back then, could I have defeated him?’</p>
<p>The remaining ice bears were thrown into chaos after losing their leader and were quickly routed by the soldiers .  The battle was over . The results greatly satisfied Jinwoo . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Shadow Infantry (Lv . 2)</strong>. </p>

<p>The soldiers had leveled up here and there .  Since the Shadow Soldiers themselves were Jinwoo’s skill, the Hunter had also gained 3 levels .  And above all else,</p>
<p>“Arise . ”</p>

<p>He had earned new friends . </p>
<p>ROOOAR-!</p>
<p>Including the alpha, Jinwoo had selected several ice bears .  From their shadows, a large black mass rose . </p>
<p>‘I expected a bear wearing an armor…’</p>
<p>The reality was a little different . </p>
<p>The ‘Shadow Beasts’[1] that arose maintained some semblance to a bear but at the same time had a form that seemed to shift between solid and gas .  A black steam continuously spewed from their figures . </p>
<p>‘The visuals are a bit lacking, but still, it’s those ice bears’ shadows . ’</p>
<p>Their strength and capacity for destruction .  He would surely have a use for it . Suddenly,</p>
<p>rooooar</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s ears perked up at a cry sounding from a distance .  It was not just one or two . </p>
<p>‘Looks like there are more dens in the area . ’</p>
<p>It was getting a little late in the day .  He’ll check it out tomorrow . </p>
<p>A bright smile appeared on Jinwoo’s face . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaak!”</p>
<p>“Kuk!”</p>
<p>His teammates were screaming left and right .  Kim Cheol’s eyes were wide open . </p>
<p>‘There is no way!’</p>
<p>That he, Kim Cheol, would fail like this! He was someone would become Baekho’s elite .  He had even received special training for that goal . And now, he was going to fail?! The A-ranker could not accept it . </p>
<p>Their party had endured the cold and hunger and fought with yetis .  After that were the ice giants . They had lost two of their members but managed to prevail against them too .  The Raid appeared to be going smooth . </p>
<p>But . </p>
<p>But!!!</p>
<p>The moment they had triumphed over the ice giants, the White Walkers ambushed them from all directions, as if they had been waiting .  Those bastards had been watching their party, waiting for their stamina to hit rock bottom . What followed was a massacre . The Hunters fell, one after another, in an instant . </p>
<p>“L-leader!”</p>
<p>A fallen Hunter stretched a bloodied hand toward Kim Cheol .  Kim Cheol stepped backwards . A White Walker appeared out of nowhere and slit the throat of the Hunter on the ground .  While the man gurgled and choked on his own blood, the White Walker raised his head towards Kim Cheol . The A-ranker screamed,</p>
<p>“U-uwaaaah!”</p>
<p>He turned around and ran into the forest .  The forest had ice bears? Those bears were nothing compared to the yetis, ice giants and the White Walkers .  Kim Cheol ran with all of his might . Watching his figure disappear into the distance, the White Walkers raised their bows and took aim .  But before they could fire, a White Walker raised his hand and stopped them . It was an ice elf with hair flowing down to his waist . The other White Walkers lowered their bows . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>The long hair pointed and gestured to follow Kim Cheol .  One by one, the other White Walkers disappeared from sight . </p>
<p>Kim Cheol leaped through a bush . </p>
<p>“pant, pant, pant . ”</p>
<p>His lungs felt like they were on fire .  The image of the White Walkers that smiled while slaughtering his teammates was still fresh on his mind .  The man looked down at his hands . The frostbitten hands were losing their sense of touch . His toes had long since lost all feeling .  He could not fight properly in his current condition . </p>
<p>‘This damn cold… No, if we just didn’t starve for the past few days, we would’ve won . ’</p>
<p>To the bitter end, Kim Cheol could not acknowledge his failure .  While muttering to himself, Kim Cheol raised his head . </p>
<p>‘Anyways, how deep am I into the forest?’</p>
<p>He looked around .  The smell of blood poked at his nose from somewhere .  The man followed the smell . It was close . Moving through the trees, he came upon a clearing and could not believe his eyes . </p>
<p>‘How is this possible?’</p>
<p>In front of the caves were over 20 ice bear corpses .  He had wondered why he hadn’t come across a single bear!</p>
<p>“What the?”</p>
<p>He studied the corpses .  All the corpses had traces of being cut with something .  Some of them also had traces of being burned . Sung Jinwoo and his party flashed across Kim Cheol’s head . </p>
<p>“It can’t be . those bastards did this?”</p>
<p>No .  Kim Cheol shook his head .  The wounds on the corpses of the ice bears were made with a sword .  To his knowledge, Sung Jinwoo’s party did not have a sword user . </p>
<p>‘The two E-rankers didn’t even have a weapon . ’</p>
<p>There was no way they had survived here .  Then there was only one other conclusion,</p>
<p>‘The White Walkers are also here!’</p>
<p>His heart sank .  He had thought that he managed to get away from those elves .  To think that he had wandered into another group of them . With a great fear in his heart, Kim Cheol held his breath and turned back to the direction he had come from . </p>
<p>Further .  Faster . </p>
<p>He wanted to get out of the White Walker’s territory . </p>
<p>At the same time . </p>
<p>“Wuwaaaaang!’</p>
<p>An ice bear fell with a death rattle .  The Shadow Soldiers swarmed its body and made sure it was dead . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve leveled up!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo was in a different bear den .  It’s been five days since they had entered the Gate .  He had gone through three different bear dens since then . </p>
<p>‘Looks like I’ve taken care of every bear in this forest . ’</p>
<p>Thanks to that, both he and his army’s levels had risen quite a bit .  At first, it required two soldiers just to hold back an ice bear . Now, a single soldier was capable of winning one on one against the beast .  Jinwoo was satisfied . As the abilities of his soldiers rose, he started assigning them different roles . His current limit was 30 shadows . 28 of them would be assigned to combat, while 2 of them would be assigned to the collection of magic cores and meat .  Now that he didn’t have to lift a finger to fight or collect drops, life became incredibly convenient for the Hunter . </p>
<p>‘I don’t sense any more magic beasts . ’</p>
<p>It seemed that he had cleared the entire forest . </p>
<p>Then . </p>
<p>‘Is it time to go for the boss?’</p>
<p>There was still about a month to go, at worst several months, until the Dungeon Break .  He had no intention of waiting for that to happen . </p>
<p>‘Gotta kill that arrogant elf too . ’</p>
<p>A mere magic beast that taunted a Hunter .  Its arrogant smile still annoyed Jinwoo . </p>
<p>Kim Cheol’s nose detected the smell of cooking meat from somewhere . </p>
<p>sniff sniff</p>
<p>The man’s sense of smell had become sensitive due to his hunger .  After entering the Gate, all he had to eat for the past few days was a single rabbit .  His mouth watered at the smell of food . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>The White Walkers might be eating somewhere . </p>
<p>‘But if there’s only few of them…’</p>
<p>He was confident he could take care of them and steal the food .  It was a misguided confidence born out of hunger . </p>
<p>‘Let’s check it out . ’</p>
<p>Kim Cheol did his best to quiet his footsteps and carefully approached where the smell was coming from .  Finally, he came upon a clearing where Jinwoo’s team was . Kim Cheol’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>The smell of meat was coming from their campfire . </p>
<p>‘How are they still alive?’</p>
<p>However, he did not see one of the E-rank Hunters . </p>
<p>‘Pft . He took the lead with such confidence . Must’ve died first . ’</p>
<p>That much was obvious .  But what wasn’t obvious was the scene in front of him .  How to… analyze all this? Something was weird . </p>
<p>‘Wait, their clothes…?’</p>
<p>Warm clothes, blankets, tents and other equipment entered his eye .  They were clearly prepared for the environment . </p>
<p>‘How the hell?’</p>
<p>While flustered, Kim Cheol’s gaze became affixed on something . </p>
<p>It was a piece of bread next to the meat .  There was no way they had found or made bread here .  It must’ve been prepared beforehand . His confusion quickly turned to anger . </p>
<p>‘These fuckers…’</p>
<p>grind</p>
<p>Kim Cheol grinded his teeth .  These fuckers had all of this with them and walked away on their own . </p>
<p>‘If my hands weren’t frozen, no, if only I wasn’t hungry, I could’ve easily taken care of those ice elves . ’</p>
<p>Thinking about how they greedily hoarded something that should’ve been shared with the Raid team, Kim Cheol could not help it any more .  He leaped out into the clearing . </p>
<p>“You bastards!”</p>
<p>Park Heejin jumped in surprise and stood up . </p>
<p>“Kim Cheol? How are you here?”</p>
<p>To be honest, it was hard to say that he was a welcoming sight .  It was because the man’s eyes were filled with murderous intent . Kim Cheol did not hide his hostility . </p>
<p>“Our party failed in clearing the Dungeon because we lacked proper equipment and food . Then how the hell are you sitting here with those equipment and food?”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>Park Heejin could not answer .  She feared that bringing up Jinwoo would turn Kim Cheol’s wrath towards Jinwoo .  She did not want to turn in the savior of her life . </p>
<p>‘From the start, I didn’t like the way that man looked at Sung Jinwoo . ’</p>
<p>Park Heejin closed her mouth .  Seeing her defy his will, Kim Cheol’s rage increased . </p>
<p>“I don’t consider every one of you an accomplice . Who hid all this? I’ll spare the rest of you . ”</p>
<p>The veins in his neck bulged . </p>
<p>“WHICH ONE OF YOU HOARDED ALL OF THIS AND ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF YOUR COMRADES?!!!”</p>
<p>His shouting echoed loudly throughout the forest .  Kim Cheol realized he would have to up the ante . </p>
<p>“I’m going to count to three . If no one speaks up, I’ll consider all of you equally guilty . ”</p>
<p>Han Songyi tugged at Park Heejin’s sleeves . </p>
<p>“U-unni…”</p>
<p>Park Heejin hugged Han Songyi .  Go Myunghwan and Yoon Gijoong also gulped while sweating .  Kim Cheol was an A-ranker . Even if they combined their powers, they could not hope to win against him .  Still, not one of them betrayed Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“One . ”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol unsheathe the sword at his side . </p>
<p>schiing-</p>
<p>“Two . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters still held their silence . </p>
<p>Mere low-level Hunters dare to disobey him? Kim Cheol’s anger flared . </p>
<p>‘How dare you look down on me…’</p>
<p>His eyes turned red with murderous intent . </p>
<p>First would be this woman .  The one who betrayed his team and decided to join the weaklings .  Park Heejin will be the first to die . </p>
<p>‘Yes . She must’ve been hiding something . That’s why she left my team . ’</p>
<p>That was the only reason he could think of .  Kim Cheol stepped up to Park Heejin and finished his countdown . </p>
<p>“Three . ”</p>
<p>Park Heejin closed her eyes . </p>
<p>Suddenly . </p>
<p>“Four . ”</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Something struck Kim Cheol on the back of the head, and the man fell face forward onto the ground and slid forward for a few feet . </p>
<p>All the Hunters’ eyes opened wide . </p>
<p>“Raid Leader!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo had struck with such a force that his fist was still smoking . </p>
<p>He spoke, appalled,</p>
<p>“Who’s the fucker that really endangered the lives of his comrades?”</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Shadow Beast” (그림자 마수병): Lit . “Shadow Magic Beast Soldier” .  I’ve removed “magic” to distinguish them from magic beasts . The reason was because in the context, “magic beast” was clearly referring to the shadow’s bear-like bestial form, but in the general story, “magic beast” refers to any otherworldly entities found in Dungeons .  I wanted to avoid the confusion . Also took out the word “soldier” because it felt redundant in most context cases . </p>
