<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 5</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s shout reached all the Hunters’ ears . </p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>“Instruments?!”</p>
<p>Hope returned to their eyes .  Unlike the time where Jinwoo asked them to bow, the Hunters this time did not hesitate to respond .  Of course, if Jinwoo was wrong on his guess, they would be massacred when they approached the statues .  But in this moment, there was not one Hunter who remained suspicious of Jinwoo’s directions . </p>
<p>Mr . Song was the first to arrive at a statue holding an instrument . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Holding his breath, Mr . Song slowly looked up at the statue .  As if responding, the statue’s fingers moved, and it started playing the harp in its hands . </p>
<p>It was a beautiful sound . </p>
<p>“He was right!”</p>
<p>“Move to the statues with instruments!”</p>
<p>Each Hunter, with renewed hope, ran towards the various statues holding instruments . </p>
<p>Trumpets, flutes, lyres .  Soon, the harmonious melody of different instruments filled the entire temple . </p>
<p>Mr . Kim, who had been running until his breath ran out, collapsed and knelt before a statue holding a mandolin . </p>
<p>strum~ strum~</p>
<p>As the mandolin’s melody rang through the air, the Statue of God that was chasing Mr . Kim slowed to a stop .  Unable to hold his emotions back, Mr . Kim burst into tears where he knelt . </p>
<p>“Uwaaaaah-“</p>
<p>And the Statue of God turned away from him .  Scanning the rest of the temple, it found its new target . </p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>Meeting its eyes, Jinwoo cursed .  And he started running, his heart beating like it was about to explode .  His sweating back was soaked . </p>
<p>‘Why! Why is this one not playing?!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo glared at the statue he had arrived at with resentment .  Holding drums in its hands, its silent figure made no indication that it would play its instrument . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>With terrifying speed, the Statue of God closed the gap between them .  As the Statue, which had been at the opposite end of the room only moments ago, neared them, Jinwoo gulped . </p>
<p>‘Is it because Juhee and I are both here at the same time?’</p>
<p>That must’ve been the answer .  As he looked around, no other Hunter had trouble with their statues . </p>
<p>‘I don’t have time to think about this,’</p>
<p>He put down Juhee and prepared to run to a different spot . </p>
<p>“Jinwoo…”</p>
<p>A terrified Juhee held onto his sleeves .  Jinwoo calmly whispered into her ears,</p>
<p>“We’ll both die if I stay . ”</p>
<p>As he saw tears forming at the corners of her eyes, Jinwoo knew that there was no time to explain .  He gently pulled away her shaking hands from his sleeves, then ran with all his might towards another statue . </p>
<p>*Ba-Bum* *Ba-Bum* *Ba-Bum*</p>
<p>He heard the beat of the drum starting from behind him as he ran . </p>
<p>‘Thank god . ’</p>
<p>There was only one thing left .  To safely make it to another statue!</p>
<p>Jinwoo was now the only one who had not made it to the protection of statues holding instruments .  Accordingly, the complete rage of the Statue of God was now focused solely on him . Jinwoo ran away from the crashing footsteps of his chaser and sped across the room . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>As he barely dodged and rolled away from the Statue’s stomps, his panting became heavier and heavier .  Although he was the lowest of the E-rank Hunters, as a Fighter-class Hunter, his body offered what little help it could in this situation . </p>
<p>‘Just a little bit more!’</p>
<p>Taking notice of the Statue of God’s footsteps closing in on him, he focused and strengthened his legs .  His speed increased . There was but a few steps until he reached his target statue . </p>
<p>“NO, NOT THAT WAY!”</p>
<p>Mr . Song had shouted at him . </p>
<p>Having focused on the Statue of God’s movements until now, Jinwoo turned his attention to the statue he had arrived at . </p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>‘It’s not holding an instrument!’</p>
<p>He now realized what appeared to be an instrument in the statue’s hands was actually a shield .  Without mercy, the statue raised and brought down the shield in its hands . </p>
<p>“Uwah!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo threw his body to the side . </p>
<p>“Kiyaah!”</p>
<p>Juhee screamed . </p>
<p>As he rolled across on the floor, he looked up .  The Statue of God was almost upon him . </p>
<p>“Out of the frying pan…”</p>
<p>His tumble on the ground had opened a cut on his forehead .  Blood flowed down to his eyes, obscuring his vision . Jinwoo rapidly looked left and right . </p>
<p>‘Instrument, instrument…’</p>
<p>But no instrument registered in his eyes . </p>
<p>The Statue of God raised its foot . </p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>Jinwoo barely evaded the stomp by throwing his body to the side .  But he was reaching his limits . Feeling faint, he found it hard to maintain balance for some reason . </p>
<p>‘Please…’</p>
<p>If there was a God, he wanted to pray to it .  In that moment, Jinwoo noticed a statue that was neither holding a weapon nor an instrument . </p>
<p>‘That’s!’</p>
<p>He crawled with last vestiges of his strength, placing his hopes on the statue .  With a final twist of his body, he threw himself at the feet of the statue with a book in its hands .  Facing the Statue of God that was heading toward him, he realized he had no strength left to move . Panting heavily, he looked at the face of the Statue of God .  As if made worse by his persistent resistance, the anger in the face that looked down upon Jinwoo was greatly magnified . </p>
<p>It stopped before Jinwoo . </p>
<p>Faced with a giant as tall as a building, Jinwoo struggled to breathe . </p>
<p>‘Guess I’m a cornered rat…’</p>
<p>The Statue of God simply continued to stare . </p>
<p>‘This is the end…’</p>
<p>Certain of his impending doom, Jinwoo saw his death in the eyes that were looking down at him . </p>
<p>In that moment, he heard a beautiful and melodious singing coming from behind him .  With effort, he turned and looked at its source . The statue that he was resting on was now singing with a holy voice; its sound echoing throughout the temple .  Looking back, Jinwoo saw the Statue of God’s face starting to relax . The traces of its demonic rage disappeared as the Statue’s face returned to its original emotionless visage . </p>
<p>As the statues’ music ended, the Statue of God turned and returned to its seat, appearing as if nothing had happened . </p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>The sound of the giant sitting down rang throughout the temple . </p>
<p>“Hah . Hah .  Are… we… safe…?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo faintly smiled through his heavy breaths . </p>
<p>Juhee quickly ran to him,</p>
<p>“Jinwoo!”</p>
<p>Having reached him after running with all her might, Juhee collapsed next to him in tears . </p>
<p>“Oh my god… oh my god…”</p>
<p>She used all the mana at her disposal and tried every healing magic she knew .  But it had no effect . </p>
<p>One by one, the scattered Hunters gathered before Jinwoo .  Their expressions equally dark . </p>
<p>“Oh no… Jinwoo . ”</p>
<p>Amidst their pitying looks and words, Juhee cried without ceasing . </p>
<p>‘Why are they looking at me like that?‘</p>
<p>Jinwoo wanted to ask, but he lacked the energy to speak .  So, he tried to gather his strength and stand up . </p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>A pool of blood had gathered where he was sitting .  Jinwoo finally was able to understand the situation he was in . </p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>His right leg had disappeared below the knees . </p>
<p>He looked across the room to the statue holding a shield .  The base of the shield was covered in blood . </p>
<p>His missing leg below it . </p>
<p>He turned and saw blood dripping down from Juhee’s nose .  Her body had reached its limits . A B-rank Hunter’s healing was insufficient for the regeneration of a body part .  Yet she continued, her efforts like collecting water with a broken pitcher . And as she continued, both her mana and vitality quickly decreased . </p>
<p>“It’s okay, Juhee .  You can stop now…”</p>
<p>“No! I can heal this! I’ll heal you!”</p>
<p>The Hunters watched the pair with pity . </p>
<p>Of the 17 that had entered, only 6 remained . </p>
<p>Of the 6 remaining, 2 had received a seriously injury . </p>
<p>Mr . Song and his arm, and now Jinwoo with his leg . </p>
<p>Although their lives were saved, no one could put on a smile . </p>
<p>Suddenly, a thundering noise rang throughout the temple . </p>
<p>At its center, the ground with the magic circle inscribed upon it started rising, forming an platform . </p>
<p>Jinwoo realized the final trial had arrived . </p>
<p>‘Prove your Faith…’</p>
<p>He had already been contemplating its meaning . </p>
<p>-5 . The Final Trial-</p>
<p>The rising ground stopped at waist height . </p>
<p>“An altar…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo absent-mindedly spoke to himself . </p>
<p>‘An altar?’</p>
<p>‘Did he just say an altar?’</p>
<p>The man who had saved their lives not once but twice; Jinwoo was not a high leveled Awakened Being[1], but a lowly E-rank Hunter that they looked down on in the past . </p>
<p>‘If it wasn’t for Mr . Sung, we would be…’</p>
<p>The Hunters’ thoughts were in union .  Jinwoo’s words up until now were a lifeline to them .  And now this man had uttered the words, “altar” . The quick-witted Mr . Kim was the first to speak,</p>
<p>“I think I understand . ”</p>
<p>He unsheathed the sword at his waist .  Normally a weapon to be used in slaying magic beasts, its purpose this time was different . </p>
<p>“Even an idiot like me can understand what you mean by ‘altar’ . ”</p>
<p>The Hunters looked at Mr . Kim’s drawn sword, gleaming with sharpness, and gulped . </p>
<p>“Hey, Mr . Kim! Why are you taking that out now?”</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about this, talk!”</p>
<p>Mr . Song’s C-rank was the highest in the party .  With him out of commission, there was no one else in the party would could match Mr . Kim, whose skill shone even amongst the other D-rankers . </p>
<p>Mr . Kim pointed his sword at the altar . </p>
<p>“The last Commandment was, ‘Prove your Faith’, and now this altar appeared in the middle of the room . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim’s gaze shifted to Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“We have to sacrifice someone at the altar, right, Mr . Sung?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded .  It was his guess as well .  One of the living 6 had to become a sacrifice . </p>
<p>‘That’s probably the last rule…’</p>
<p>As he raised his head, he saw Mr . Kim approaching him with a strange look in his eyes .  A streak of sweat fell down the side of Jinwoo’s head . </p>
<p>“Ahjussi… what are you going to-”</p>
<p>“Just sit there quietly!”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim pointed his sword at Mr . Song, who had been sitting next to Jinwoo looking over his injuries . </p>
<p>“Who is the one who dragged us all here? It’s Mr . Song right here! Then shouldn’t he be the one to pay the price for all this?!”</p>
<p>“Ahjussi!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo yelled and tried to get up, but Mr . Song’s hands stopped him .  Jinwoo turned and look at the man . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Song shook his head without a word .  His eyes begged Jinwoo to stay quiet . Jinwoo wanted to say something, but swallowed his words .  Mr . Song slowly got up . </p>
<p>“Mr . Kim is right .  I have to take responsibility . ”</p>
<p>“Then we’re in agreement, old man . ”</p>
<p>Mr . Kim gestured towards the altar with his sword . </p>
<p>“If you’re in, then let’s hurry up .  11 people died because of you . ”</p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Awakening Being” (각성자; gak-sung-ja): “to awaken” gak-sung + “person” ja &gt; a person who had underwent Awakening .  All Hunters are Awakened Beings . Not all Awakened Beings work as Hunters . </p>
