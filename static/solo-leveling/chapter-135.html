<h3>Chapter 135: Chapter 135</h3> 
<p>Beru was the first to make his move . His Sovereign had given him only one order </p>
<p>'Defeat the enemy without harming her . '. </p>
<p>Beru once stood at the peak of his species, and he knew what the best method to perfectly fulfil that order was . And that would be this: Make the opponent lose her will to fight by imprinting the clear gap in power between them in her mind </p>
<p>Paht!. </p>
<p>Beru disappeared from Cha Hae-In's view the moment he moved, before reappearing right in front of her nose even before she had the chance to realise it </p>
<p>" . !!". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In's animal-like instinct kicked in even as the astonishment at Beru's speed nearly overwhelmed her, and she swung her sword at her opponent . She followed that up with dozens more </p>
<p>However, Beru stood in the spot and evaded all of her attacks without taking a single step </p>
<p>It was a precise movement that eliminated all necessary motion . He was so bloody quick that afterimages were left behind in his wake . This was the display of an unbridgeable gap in their power levels </p>
<p>'This is impossible!'. </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In's eyes shook hard every time she missed </p>
<p>'It can dodge all my attacks at such a close distance without moving its legs once?'. </p>
<p>Just one more time!. </p>
<p>She took aim at the neck of her opponent and took a swing, but the creature lightly evaded it by leaning back slightly . No matter where she attacked from, or how she changed her attacks, her opponent easily dodged them all </p>
<p>'How can this be ?!'. </p>
<p>This thing wasn't even alive anymore . This thing was a summon borrowing the powers of the dead monster, so how could it still be this strong?. </p>
<p>And also . </p>
<p>'Mister Seong Jin-Woo, who can freely control such a summon, just what . '. </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In's movements became a tad dull from the vague fear invading her, and Beru seized upon this opportunity to smack her incoming sword away with the back of his hand . And then, pressed his face closer to hers </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In froze up on the spot as the stench of death blew right into her face </p>
<p>'This is the end . '. </p>
<p>She inadvertently gasped out the moment those huge mandibles filled up her view </p>
<p>"Ah!". </p>
<p>However, the creature didn't crush her head by snapping shut its maws but instead, chose to screech out loudly right in front of her face </p>
<p>"Kiiiieeeeehhhk!!". </p>
<p>She was knocked away ungainly from the screech containing his magical energy </p>
<p>"Kyahk!". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo grimaced while watching that . Indeed, there was no way he'd start enjoying the sight of someone else getting knocked around one-sidedly like this </p>
<p>However, she stood back up again and fixed the grip on the sword as if to show that she wasn't giving up at all . Jin-Woo tilted his head </p>
<p>'What is she trying to do?'. </p>
<p>The Cha Hae-In he knew wasn't a low-class Hunter who didn't want to accept the difference between her and her opponent even after confirming the truth with her own eyes </p>
<p>'And she's definitely not reckless enough to keep attacking when she knows of the gap, too . '. </p>
<p>In that case, could she still be in possession of one more card up her sleeve?. </p>
<p>'Whatever it is, I hope she's not making an incorrect call . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was mentally linked with Beru, so he could feel how much his soldier was suppressing its killing intent at the moment . On the other hand, Cha Ha-In's will remained unyielding, even though she found herself in an absolutely disadvantageous position </p>
<p>He was getting a bad premonition here . Jin-Woo's expression became even more serious as he watched the two of them </p>
<p>'… ?'. </p>
<p>On the hand, Beru had failed to understand Cha Ha-In's decision </p>
<p>He had displayed their overwhelming gap in power several times by now . So, why hadn't she stop her challenges yet?. </p>
<p>The former king of ants, a being who lorded over others at the apex of the food chain, was beginning to get displeased by the human female's stubbornness . The basis of his anger stemmed from the past memory of him being a ruler </p>
<p>'How dare . '. </p>
<p>The moment Beru made up his mind, he arrived before Cha Hae-In in the blink of an eye . He then pressed his face closer to glare straight into her eyes </p>
<p>Any lifeform still breathing would've immediately realised who was the predator and the prey in this situation just from their gazes meeting like this . It would be a warning from one's primal instinct </p>
<p>Beru planned to awaken that instinct of his opponent and make her lose her will to fight in that manner, but unfortunately, his ploy wasn't as effective as he thought </p>
<p>Just as Jin-Woo had predicted, Cha Hae-In still held one last trump card to fall back on </p>
<p>The skill, 'Sword Dance', one she was most proficient in wielding . Her movements sped up as if she was performing a deadly dance, and the tip of her sword drew splendid arcs in the air </p>
<p>Paht! Paht! Paht!. </p>
<p>Too bad . </p>
<p>Beru used his claws to easily defend against all those smoothly flowing attacks that had no interruptions in between . At the end of the barrage, his expression crumpled unsightly </p>
<p>'No more playing around . '. </p>
<p>Beru snatched the sword flying at him with his bare hand and crushed it </p>
<p>Kwajeeck!!. </p>
<p>She only had half a sword left, but rather than falling into despair, her glare became icy cold, instead </p>
<p>'I have only one last chance!'. </p>
<p>Every single drop of magic energy in her was poured into the broken sword to activate her skill, 'Blade of Light' </p>
<p>The magic energy expenditure for this skill was far too great and she could only use it as the final hurrah . And for the first time during this fight, she revealed it in its full glory </p>
<p>The blade of light shone brilliantly </p>
<p>Beru had lowered his guard for a moment after breaking her sword, and she used that opening to jump into his front and stabbed the blade of light forward </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's eyes widened </p>
<p>'Nooo!'. </p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't worried about Beru . Utterly disregarding his worries, the blade glowing in golden light pierced deeply into Beru's tummy </p>
<p>"Kiiieehhk-!!". </p>
<p>In that brief moment, Beru's mind spun quickly </p>
<p>'This woman is an enemy . '. </p>
<p>It'd not be a problem for him to die . However, if he fell here, then this woman's sword would point towards his Sovereign next </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>An instinct buried deep within all Shadow Soldiers' psyche, one designed to activate in times of great distress and override everything else, wiggled back into life </p>
<p>- "Protect the Sovereign!". </p>
<p>In that moment, inside of Beru's head blanked out into a 'reset' state and the order Jin-Woo gave him, 'defeat the enemy without harming her' was wiped away completely </p>
<p>Beru transformed into a terrifying monster in order to protect Jin-Woo . His body ballooned up to a giant proportions . His mandibles split wide open as if he was getting ready to chew on steel, and finally, his claws extended out to resemble a group of sharp blades!. </p>
<p>"Stop!!". </p>
<p>Beru finished getting ready to rip apart his owner's enemy, and swung all ten of his claws and their sharp edges at his target </p>
<p>Swish-!!. </p>
<p>Just before all ten blades reached Cha Hae-In . </p>
<p>Grab!. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo managed to make it just in time </p>
<p>" I told you to stop, didn't I?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo stopped both sets of Beru's claws with his bare hands and began glaring at his soldier . Beru met that enraged glare and began shuddering . He quickly leapt back and, while not even bothering to pull that sword of light from his midriff, prostrated flat on the ground and begged for forgiveness </p>
<p>"Oh, oh my king . Mercy . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo knew what this guy was thinking of the moment he was about to act . Hell, the singular thought of 'Protect the Sovereign' was ringing really loud inside his head, too </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo glared at Beru for a little while, before shifting his gaze away </p>
<p>Plop </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In was completely spent and, unable to stand any longer, plopped down to the ground . She knew that she just came face to face with death again during that brief moment </p>
<p>"Are you alright?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo walked closer . She was trying to push herself back up, but gave up in the end and, while keeping her gaze rooted to the floor, nodded her head </p>
<p>"I am fine . ". </p>
<p>'Fine, my foot . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo supported her up and asked </p>
<p>"Why were you pushing yourself that hard? I mean, you shouldn't have any reasons to enter my Guild while putting yourself through a wringer like this, right?". </p>
<p>" . ". </p>
<p>Indeed, this was supposed to be a simple test . More than that, this was a 'test' he cooked up to reject her tactfully . But, to think, she'd be this obsessed about winning, even to the extent of using such a dangerous skill, too </p>
<p>This couldn't be chalked up to her desire to win at all costs . That was why . </p>
<p>"Could it be . ". </p>
<p>… . Jin-Woo cautiously asked her, so as to not damage her ego </p>
<p>"Are you perhaps interested in me?". </p>
<p>"Excuse me??". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In got flustered and formed a dazed expression of someone getting hit in the back of her head . Jin-Woo tilted his head </p>
<p>'That wasn't it, either?'. </p>
<p>But then, Cha Hae-In carefully reorganised her thoughts and corrected her answer </p>
<p>" Yes, I think so . ". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Within the United States' Hunter Bureau </p>
<p>The director was feeling rather unhappy after receiving the news of Hunter Seong Jin-Woo's recruitment ending in failure . Instead of getting a report, he summoned the deputy director to the conference chamber </p>
<p>The deputy director brought Madam Selner with him </p>
<p>"Explain what happened back there . ". </p>
<p>The director asked even before they had the chance to sit down . This was the first time since the founding of the Hunter Bureau that their scouting offer, accompanied by Madam Selner no less, had been rejected by the subject </p>
<p>The deputy stood up with a darkened expression and lowered his head </p>
<p>"I'm truly sorry, sir . ". </p>
<p>"I didn't call you here for your apologies, Michael . ". </p>
<p>The director pressed a certain button, and all the glass walls were covered up and the exit was locked tight . The interior had become perfectly soundproof </p>
<p>In order to prevent the leakage of information, all matters pertaining to Madam Selner were never discussed over the phone or through emails . That was why the director was still unaware of what went down in South Korea until now </p>
<p>"Now, please explain to me what happened . ". </p>
<p>The deputy director glanced at Madam Selner for a moment or two . She slowly nodded her head, and only then did the deputy open his tightly-shut lips once more </p>
<p>"Madam Selner was able to 'observe' Hunter Seong Jin-Woo . ". </p>
<p>"What was the result?". </p>
<p>The director knew how her power operated, so the result of her 'observation' was as important as the result of the 'recruitment' itself </p>
<p>"Hunter Seong Jin-Woo is ". </p>
<p>The deputy licked his dried-up lips from tension and continued on </p>
<p>" Is apparently one of the 'kings' . ". </p>
<p>"What?!". </p>
<p>The director jumped up from his seat </p>
<p>Of all the powerful Hunters she had met over the years, she described only three people as 'kings' . And all three of them were powerful enough to shake the world by the scruff of its neck, too </p>
<p>Quite literally, they were the zenith of Hunters! And the man named Seong Jin-Woo had to be included in that list now, as well </p>
<p>The director shifted his gaze over to Madam Selner and asked her </p>
<p>"Does that mean Hunter Seong Jin-Woo possesses the level of power equal to other Special Authority-rank Hunters?". </p>
<p>Strangely enough, she promptly shook her head </p>
<p>"Excuse me?". </p>
<p>Frowns formed on the director's forehead </p>
<p>The deputy could amply understand how his boss must be feeling right about now . He, too, had displayed a similar reaction back when he heard the exact same answer, after all </p>
<p>Madam Selner let out a long sigh </p>
<p>"Looks like . I'll have to explain myself a little . ". </p>
<p>Her talk began from those words </p>
<p>"First of all I'll assume that both of you know just what kind of an ability I possess . ". </p>
<p>The director and his deputy both nodded their heads simultaneously . The former spoke first </p>
<p>"You said that the Awakened are people connected to the powers of the 'other side' . ". </p>
<p>By staring into the eyes of the Awakened, Madam Selner could sense the 'passageway' connecting said Awakened to the other side </p>
<p>However, she said that there were certain Awakened who were receiving so much incredible power from the 'other side' that it ends up resembling a blinding flood of light, instead </p>
<p>These were precisely the 'kings' she talked about </p>
<p>"So, what is different about Hunter Seong Jin-Woo, then?". </p>
<p>"He doesn't have a passageway . ". </p>
<p>Madam shivered in fear again </p>
<p>"When I looked into his eyes, the darkness within him was staring back at me . Oh, my god . He was the darkness itself . ". </p>
<p>The deputy director refuted this immediately </p>
<p>"But, he has helped out a lot of people during his tenure as a Hunter, and I can't see him as someone as evil as you describe him to be ". </p>
<p>If Hunter Seong Jin-Woo was indeed a vicious, evil individual, he'd have immediately killed the two agents who pointed guns at him where they stood . However, he just let that slide without caring too much about it </p>
<p>Madam shook her head </p>
<p>"I wasn't talking about whether Hunter Seong Jin-Woo was a good or evil man, deputy director . ". </p>
<p>The light shining in her eyes was determined </p>
<p>"No, I'm talking about the origin of his power . ". </p>
<p>The director had been listening to her with his hands pressed below his chin until then, but he finally raised his voice </p>
<p>"There's no mistaking that he's a powerful Hunter, yes?". </p>
<p>Madam nodded her head </p>
<p>"Hunter Seong Jin-Woo, he's not borrowing someone else's power . He only relies on the power residing within him, so he's not restricted by the passageway . Which means . ". </p>
<p>"There's no limit to his power . ". </p>
<p>The deputy director muttered absently before breaking into an abrupt shudder . He couldn't even begin to imagine how absurd the level of power gushing out without any limit could potentially be </p>
<p>The director fell into a deep thought after he heard both of his guests . And a short while later, he nodded his head, evidently having made his mind up over something </p>
<p>"Madam, thank you for your hard work . ". </p>
<p>After seeing Madam Selner off, the director headed down to the underground floors of the Hunter Bureau with his deputy in tow </p>
<p>"Director, where are we going?". </p>
<p>"Ninth basement floor . ". </p>
<p>"Isn't that where we store old records?". </p>
<p>"We have something else secured there besides the records . ". </p>
<p>The director watched as the number on the elevator's display panel steadily decrease and continued on </p>
<p>"If we can't rely on Madam Selner's power, then we should use a different method to bring him in . ". </p>
<p>That man was still so young . And he possessed unfathomable power </p>
<p>If Hunter Seong Jin-Woo indeed possessed incredible power just as Madam Selner had eluded to, then it no longer mattered whether that was the power of light or the power of darkness </p>
<p>A knife you picked up to protect yourself would look like a deadly weapon from someone else's perspective . And the director wanted to possess the knife called Seong Jin-Woo </p>
<p>They arrived at their destination, and while unlocking a series of electronic door locks, steadily walked deeper into the ninth underground floor . A few Bureau agents greeted them as they walked past, but the director didn't even spare a single glance </p>
<p>"Do you still recall the very first rank S Gate ever to appear?". </p>
<p>"Of course . ". </p>
<p>How could anyone forget the worst dungeon break in history that destroyed a portion of the Western United States?. </p>
<p>The American government summoned in the world's most powerful Hunters with an unbelievably huge amount of reward on offer, and eventually, they succeeded in killing the boss-level monster that emerged from that rank S Gate </p>
<p>However, only five survived that encounter . Meaning, just a single monster managed to kill dozens of the best Hunters out there . Without their sacrifice, the nation of the United States of America might have ceased to exist altogether </p>
<p>That was why the American government bestowed the five remaining saviours the rights equalling that of the country itself, and that's where the term 'Special Authority-rank' originated from </p>
<p>The director mouthed the name of the monster that brought upon one of the worst tragedies in the history of mankind </p>
<p>"Kamish the Dragon ". </p>
<p>Didn't the Mage-type Hunters say that 'Kamish' meant an undying flame?. </p>
<p>They entered the deepest room on the floor, and the director opened the safe found in there . And that's when a single Rune Stone, under a heavy guard and being monitored constantly, revealed itself </p>
<p>The deputy director flinched in surprise </p>
<p>"In that case, could that thing be ?". </p>
<p>"Your guess is correct . ". </p>
<p>The director placed his hand on top of the reinforced glass shielding the Rune Stone and formed a smile </p>
<p>"This Rune Stone came out from that Kamish's corpse . ". </p>
<p>Two of the Special Authority-rank Hunters settled down in the US after the end of the Kamish raid . In a way, they were the gifts that Kamish managed to deliver to the US </p>
<p>To avoid another calamity like this, the Americans established the Hunter Bureau and focused all their might on improving the strengths of the Hunters . Around eight years passed by since then </p>
<p>Simply because no Mage-type Hunters were among the surviving Special Authority-rank Hunters, Kamish's Rune Stone was tucked away in this cold underground storage beneath the Hunter Bureau, waiting for a new owner to come along </p>
<p>The director formed a meaningful smile as he peered into the glass case </p>
<p>"Kamish will present us with yet another invaluable gift to our beautiful country very soon . ". </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 135 &gt; Fin </p>
