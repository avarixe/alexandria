<h3>Chapter 143: Chapter 143</h3> 
<p>Right away, Guroktaru felt every hair on its body stand up </p>
<p>'What is this?'. </p>
<p>As time slowed down from the extreme tension it felt, the Orc Chieftain's instincts of a warrior, trained to their very limit, sent out countless warning bells . It said that a truly 'terrifying' being was headed this way </p>
<p>Badump!!. </p>
<p>The sound of the Orc's heartbeat rang around painfully in its eardrums, like a series of thunderclaps </p>
<p>If it didn't get out of here right now, it'd be killed </p>
<p>The sharp instincts of a warrior, honed like a fine blade, would sometimes display powers close to that of the gift of foresight . Just like right now!. </p>
<p>'… !!'. </p>
<p>Guroktaru quickly discarded the human female and with the movements akin to a wild animal, fled to the door of the classroom </p>
<p>BOOM!!. </p>
<p>A mighty, ear-splitting explosion occurred next, the shards of glass flying out like shrapnel . Meanwhile, Orcs manning the doorways began hastily retreating away after the back of their Chieftain suddenly appeared in front of their eyes </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>Guroktaru wordlessly glared forward, its breathing now becoming extremely cautious </p>
<p>It was picking up on an unusual and eerie vibe . It could see a human male it hadn't seen before standing on the spot where the human female was just now </p>
<p>Guroktaru shifted its gaze ever so slightly to the side </p>
<p>Its opposite corner was where the windows were . Nothing remained of the entirety of that wall as if it had been struck by a powerful siege weapon </p>
<p>'Did the human enter by breaking through the windows?'. </p>
<p>Even with its excellent dynamic visual acuity, the Orc Chieftain still failed to follow that man's movements </p>
<p>'… '. </p>
<p>Guroktaru could only swallow its saliva at the sudden entrance of a powerful opponent . A strand of cold sweat trickled down its temple </p>
<p>Kiiiaaahhk-!!. </p>
<p>Guroktaru's head snapped upwards after it heard that screech </p>
<p>Past the ceiling, beyond the roof – yet another powerful enemy was circling around above the Orc's head like a hawk waiting for prey to emerge </p>
<p>'This might become a difficult fight . '. </p>
<p>Guroktaru's eyes were now dyed in the colour of nervousness, something that didn't exist only a few moments ago </p>
<p>The new enemy completely ignored the presence of the Orc Chieftain and its underlings, and simply proceeded to confirm the human female's condition </p>
<p>Guroktaru spoke to its enemy </p>
<p>"I am Guroktaru, from the proud tribe of Red Blade!". </p>
<p>That was the warrior's introduction only granted to an opponent capable of reaping away the Orc's life . Having completed its introduction, Guroktaru asked the human male </p>
<p>"And who are you?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo raised his head and quietly spoke </p>
<p>"Shut your mouth and quietly wait for your turn over there . ". </p>
<p>A human just used the language of the Orcs?. </p>
<p>The Orc's surprise lasted only for a moment </p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the power carried in that man's voice, none of the Orcs, which included Guroktaru itself, could even dare to budge an inch from the spot </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>"Cough, cough . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo gently patted Jin-Ah's back as she continued to cough and wheeze while he carefully checked to see if she had sustained any injuries . Thankfully, he couldn't see any </p>
<p>… . With the sole exception of the handprint clearly visible on her neck, that was . Jin-Woo asked, his expression hard and unforgiving </p>
<p>"Are you alright?". </p>
<p>"Oppa!!". </p>
<p>Jin-Ah finally stopped coughing and jumped into his embrace, tears streaming from her eyes </p>
<p>Jin-Woo gently stroked her hair as if he was soothing a scared child </p>
<p>' . Oppa?'. </p>
<p>'Jin-Ah's Oppa . that means ?'. </p>
<p>'Ah!'. </p>
<p>The students finally realised who the man in front of their eyes was . He was Seong Jin-Woo, a Hunter ranked S!. </p>
<p>'We're saved!!'. </p>
<p>The students confirmed Jin-Woo's face and began sobbing again . These tears weren't of despair and fear like the ones from before, but were formed from the mixture of joy and relief they felt </p>
<p>"Sob, sob . ". </p>
<p>"It's fine now . I'm here, so everything will be okay . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo gently soothed his sobbing sister, while extending his sensory perception to the rest of the school . And, within this large school building, the only presence of humans he could pick up on was 17 </p>
<p>'… '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's hardened complexion was now dyed in the darkness of rage </p>
<p>He very cautiously separated his sister from him as she tried hard not to leave his side . He then called out his Shadow Soldiers matching the exact number of the surviving students </p>
<p>"Everyone, follow my summons out of the building . ". </p>
<p>The students nodded their heads, and the soldiers proceeded to pick up them up in an embrace . As for Jin-Ah, he entrusted her especially to Igrit </p>
<p>"Please wait for me downstairs, okay? I'm going to join you very soon after dealing with this . ". </p>
<p>Normally, Jin-Ah would try to stop her oppa, telling him that they should go together regardless of whether he was a rank S Hunter or not . No, she'd still say that even if he was something greater </p>
<p>But now She couldn't do that </p>
<p>Because, Jin-Woo's current expression was far, far too scary for her to say those words . So, Jin-Ah could only nod her head </p>
<p>Jin-Woo gave out his signal, and the soldiers carrying the students jumped outside of the destroyed wall one by one . Orcs in the corridor flinched slightly at the sight of the almost-caught prey making their escape . When that happened, Jin-Woo glared at them with his ice-cold eyes </p>
<p>"I told you not to move . ". </p>
<p>Like some kind of a lie, all Orcs stopped moving altogether . None of them could go against his glare </p>
<p>One of the Orcs, its complexion utterly pale, sneaked its gaze around and cautiously whispered to Guroktaru </p>
<p>"C-chief ". </p>
<p>"Shush . ". </p>
<p>Guroktaru was in agreement with that Orc, though </p>
<p>It was true that right now wasn't the time to care about those weak prey escaping . No, they should be minding the 'hunter' right in front of their eyes . A fight between hunters would commence very soon, where who eats who would be determined </p>
<p>'Even then We can't let them get away that easily . '. </p>
<p>Guroktaru sent out a sneaky little signal, and two of its guards moved without making any sounds </p>
<p>After confirming that all of the students had left the classroom safely, Jin-Woo turned around to face the Orcs . He didn't let them leave because he was worried about them getting injured </p>
<p>'These measly Orcs '. </p>
<p>He was confident of killing them all in the blink of an eye </p>
<p>He simply didn't want to show his little sister or other kids what was about to happen in here, that was all </p>
<p>And now, there were no more eyes watching . Meaning, there was nothing to restrict his actions now </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's gaze briefly drifted towards the stairs outside the classroom . He sensed two Orcs going downstairs while hiding their presence to the best of their abilities . It seemed that they were going after the kids, but . it didn't matter </p>
<p>He had sent Igrit there, and Kaisel was circling around in the air, too </p>
<p>'So, the remaining task is to deal with these lot, then . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo exhaled softly . The exiting air contained a heavy, dense amount of magic energy </p>
<p>Guroktaru asked him again </p>
<p>"Who are you? How can you speak our tongue?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo ignored the Orc's words and slowly made his way over to them . Realising that the human male had no intentions to answer back, Guroktaru bared its fangs and shouted out </p>
<p>"Attack!". </p>
<p>The brave Orc warriors pounced on Jin-Woo all at once after hearing the Chieftain's order </p>
<p>"Kurururuk!". </p>
<p>"Kurarak!". </p>
<p>When they did . the time froze </p>
<p>Within this freeze-frame of a moment, Jin-Woo leisurely walked in between the Orcs that were moving agonisingly slowly, and proceeded to destroy them one by one </p>
<p>He didn't even need to take his weapons out . He only needed to use his finger . Every time Jin-Woo's finger brushed by an Orc, heads, shoulders, wrists, waists and midriffs of the monsters exploded into bits . And after utterly destroying over twenty Orcs in one blink of an eye . </p>
<p>Jin-Woo stood before Guroktaru </p>
<p>The Orc Chieftain could only barely keep up with Jin-Woo's afterimage with its eyes . Its trembling lips parted with much difficulty </p>
<p>"W-what ?". </p>
<p>It didn't even have a chance to swing its scimitar . Jin-Woo's left hand grabbed Guroktaru's mouth and jaw, and the Orc could only whimper pathetically </p>
<p>"Keok!". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo walked forward just like that and slammed the Orc's head against the corridor's wall </p>
<p>SLAM!!. </p>
<p>The empty corridor reverberated with the thunderous boom </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's gaze shifted towards either end of the corridor . It was filled with the remains of the students . It was truly a hard-to-look gruesome sight to behold </p>
<p>However, Jin-Woo didn't avert his gaze and imprinted the sight of every single one of these kids in his mind, just so he could demand reparations from the guilty one responsible </p>
<p>Jin-Woo shifted his eyes to Guroktaru </p>
<p>"Why?". </p>
<p>His voice was incomparably icy </p>
<p>"Why does your kind want to kill humans to this extreme level?". </p>
<p>Guroktaru had long lost its desire to resist and could only tremble in fear as it replied </p>
<p>"In, in our heads, telling us to kill humans ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo became momentarily confused </p>
<p>'Kill humans?'. </p>
<p>He had heard of the exact same thing before . But, back then, he interpreted the word 'humans' as another term for 'Hunters' </p>
<p>But it seemed that the word 'human' really did mean all humans, now that he got to hear this monster's reply </p>
<p>"Then? What about me?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo asked the Orc again </p>
<p>"Do you not hear the voice telling you to kill me?". </p>
<p>He brought his face closer </p>
<p>It was inevitable that Guroktaru would look into Jin-Woo's eyes . The Orc began shaking its head and shivered hard as if it had discovered something in there </p>
<p>"F, f-forgive Forgive, me ". </p>
<p>Something impossible happened . The brave and mighty great warrior of the Orc race began shedding tears like a little child . Jin-Woo felt the inside of his head suddenly cool off as he watched the terrified monster cowering before him </p>
<p>'So, that's how it is '. </p>
<p>He was not being seen as a human even in this guy's head, was that it?. </p>
<p>'… . Well, it doesn't really matter . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo wasn't all that interested in how monsters viewed him . No, he simply killed them because they were out to harm humans </p>
<p>Guroktaru shivered and continued sob as the fear it couldn't overcome completely enveloped it </p>
<p>"Please forgive . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo replied </p>
<p>"I'll forgive you . ". </p>
<p>And then, he summoned the 'Demon King's Shortsword' </p>
<p>"However, do not think that the process will be a painless one for you . ". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The Knight Order Guild's assault team could only gasp out in astonishment while spectating on the battles of the monsters </p>
<p>"Heok!". </p>
<p>"H-how could it be ". </p>
<p>How could anyone call this a raid now? Because, the ants very easily subdued the undead monsters and then, began greedily devouring them </p>
<p>Crunch, crunch . </p>
<p>The eyes of the Hunters opened wider and wider from this horrifying spectacle </p>
<p>"B-but, if they eat up everything like that, nothing will be left behind, you know?". </p>
<p>"Right . Even the Magic Crystals ". </p>
<p>The Hunters could only anxiously look on as the top-class Magic Crystals all ended up in the stomachs of these monsters, no, summoned creatures </p>
<p>Unable to watch from the sidelines any longer, Jeong Ye-Rim hastily ran out </p>
<p>"Don't you know how expensive that is?!". </p>
<p>She tried to wrestle away the corpse of a Vampire, but that only managed to annoy the ant, and the creature swung its arm at her direction </p>
<p>"Ahk!". </p>
<p>She cried out and tumbled backwards after the ant's claw cut into her forearm </p>
<p>Plop </p>
<p>"O-ouch . ". </p>
<p>Just as she tried to get up while rubbing her butt . </p>
<p>"Kururuk-!". </p>
<p>By the time she regained her wits, the ant monster that swung its arm was standing before her . The creature had its gigantic maw and its horrifying mandibles wide open as if to swallow her head whole </p>
<p>Jeong Ye-Rim's expression froze stiff at that moment </p>
<p>"Ah Ah ". </p>
<p>It was then . Beru had come swooping in and turned that ant around . He opened his own maw wide just like how this ant did a moment ago, and then . </p>
<p>"Kiiiieeeeehhhk-!!!". </p>
<p> . And then, he screeched out incredibly loudly </p>
<p>Being subjected to the rage of an existence on another level, the ant creature couldn't even meet Beru's gaze and simply shivered in fear </p>
<p>"K-keeiick ". </p>
<p>Beru let go of the ant's shoulder, causing the creature to hurriedly scurry away from there . Jeong Ye-Rim watched this scene play out in a total daze, but Beru approached her and extended his hand out </p>
<p>'Uh . ?'. </p>
<p>Still stupefied over everything, she grabbed the offered hand and was able to finally stand back up </p>
<p>"I, uh . T-tha ". </p>
<p>She was about to say something, only for her lips to stop . Because, she saw the gentle blue light circulating around Beru's fingertips, that was why </p>
<p>" Healing magic?!". </p>
<p>Jeong Ye-Rim's brows shot up real high in surprise </p>
<p>The wound in her arm healed up immediately the moment that blue light touched her . After confirming that her wound was completely cured, Beru turned towards the ants and shouted out </p>
<p>"Khe-ehck!". </p>
<p>That caused the ants to end their mealtime and began moving deeper into the dungeon's interior </p>
<p>Jeong Ye-Rim watched the back of Beru and murmured to herself </p>
<p>"How can a summon cast better healing magic than me??". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The Hunters finally arrived in the school </p>
<p>They followed the direction the needle of the magic compass was pointing to and climbed up the stairs . An incredible magic energy reaction was coming from the sixth floor's corridor </p>
<p>The man in charge of the Hunters looked behind at his group and spoke </p>
<p>"Be careful . ". </p>
<p>The Hunters nodded their heads </p>
<p>And when they eventually arrived on the sixth floor, they got to discover two things </p>
<p>"Heok!!". </p>
<p>One, an Orc sliced up into so many pieces that it was impossible to count; two, a lone man covered in blood standing still with a shortsword in his hand </p>
<p>'And that person is ?'. </p>
<p>The leader of the assault team met Jin-Woo's icy cold eyes and his breath nearly came to a sudden stop . But he recovered somehow and picked up the walkie talkie </p>
<p>"Yes, Hunter Seong Jin-Woo is here . ". </p>
<p>The leader took a look around and made another report </p>
<p>"The situation has been resolved . ". </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 143 &gt; Fin </p>
