<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 16</p>
<p>“Er, yes, that’s right…”</p>
<p>“Ah, I apologize .  This way, sir . I’ll lead the way . ”</p>
<p>“Ah… Okay . ”</p>
<p>Thinking that it would be a headache to try and clear up whatever misunderstanding this was, Jinwoo decided to go with the soldier for now .  As he followed, he observed his surroundings,</p>
<p>‘Now that I take a closer look…’</p>
<p>Something had clearly happened in the area .  The roads were empty, and the only people around were soldiers and policemen .  On top of that, the area was scattered with abandoned cars, damaged buildings and the corpses of magic beasts . </p>
<p>Jinwoo roughly understood what had happened . </p>
<p>‘Looks like a Dungeon Break[1] happened nearby . ’</p>
<p>In today’s world, the proper management and monitoring of Gates meant that most of them were discovered on time and taken care of .  However, every once in a while, a Gate appears in a hidden place and goes unnoticed until it’s too late . Once that happens, the military is deployed to buy time before the Hunters can arrive . </p>
<p>Of course, the weapons of the military did not work on the magic beasts .  Yet they still fought to the best of their abilities; in order to protect the citizens and provide time for their escape, someone had to be the sacrifice .  As such, the military bravely stood up and became meat shields . It was a job that had to be done, and the young men of this country nobly did that job . </p>
<p>“Thank you . ”</p>
<p>The soldier that was leading him suddenly thanked Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“It’s thanks to the Hunter-nims that we are able to live . ”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>.  . </p>
<p>Gratitude . </p>
<p>Jinwoo was the one who wanted to thank the soldier . </p>
<p>The soldier to the Hunter .  The Hunter to the soldier . </p>
<p>As men who both fought to protect the people, both sides wanted to thank the other . </p>
<p>. <strong>“ . Roger .  Over and out . ”</strong>. </p>
<p>The soldier’s face lit up after receiving a report through his radio . </p>
<p>“Most of the magic beasts in the area have been taken care of .  They said there is just one big one remaining . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded .  He already knew this without the soldier’s report .  Through his raised sense stat, he was able to detect the presence of a powerful lifeform nearby, surrounded by the energy of multiple hunters .  </p>
<p>His instincts told him the powerful lifeform was the boss . </p>
<p>Soon, the boss’s figure came into their view .  In an empty lot ahead, ten-something Hunters were fighting with a giant made out of stone .  The giant’s height was a little above a street light; it was a golem type magic beast . </p>
<p>“My god…”</p>
<p>The soldier took a step back .  As if it was the first time he had seen a magic beast, the man froze as he saw the golem .  Any ordinary human would do the same . The presence of a magic beast in person was quite different than seeing it over the television or a computer screen . </p>
<p>Compared to the soldier, Jinwoo calmly looked over to the battle . </p>
<p>“Healers! Please focus your healing on the Tanker!”</p>
<p>“We’re doing our best!”</p>
<p>“Why is it not going down!”</p>
<p>“Dealers[2], what are you doing?! He doesn’t seem like he’s taking any damage!”</p>
<p>“His defense is too high! We need a few Mage-class Hunters!”</p>
<p>As Hunters who were called over on a short notice, their ranks did not appear to be that high .  Both their defense and offense were lacking . </p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The golem slammed his stone fist onto the ground, and resulting shockwave caused the Hunter in charge of tanking to buckle . </p>
<p>“Cough!”</p>
<p>The man spat out blood . </p>
<p>“Oh no!”</p>
<p>“The Tanker’s going go die at this rate!”</p>
<p>“What can we do?! Our magic power’s almost gone!”</p>
<p>“Where are the high rankers?!”</p>
<p>The Hunters were reaching their limits . </p>
<p>As he watched, Jinwoo’s gaze sharpened . </p>
<p>‘If it’s this much… I should be able to do it . ’</p>
<p>He slowly took few steps backwards .  All the golem type boss had going for it was its high defense; its overall level seemed to be low .  Compared to the pressure he faced against the ‘blue poisoned-fanged whatever[3]’, the golem was a step below . </p>
<p>‘So if I can just get through its defense . ’</p>
<p>What the Hunters needed was a powerful attack to get through that stupid piece of rock .  At a good distance, Jinwoo cocked his arm back into a throwing position . He tightened his grip on the broken sword, and the muscles of his arm expanded .  Thick veins appeared all the way to the back of his hand . </p>
<p>All of his strength was focused on his right arm . </p>
<p>Then, the arm that was drawn back like a bowstring shot forward at the speed of sound . </p>
<p>“Go!”</p>
<p>The D-rank Hunter, Lee Hansoo, despaired; he was at his limit .  The shield that he was so proud of was cracking . The healing Hunters’ magic power must’ve hit rock bottom; the healing on him had decreased noticeably .  At this rate, the entire party would be wiped out . </p>
<p>He had to make a difficult choice . </p>
<p>He decided to buy time for the other Hunters to run away and hope that the high ranking Hunters would arrive in time to take the golem down . </p>
<p>‘Or else we’ll all die here . ’</p>
<p>Lee Hansoo’s brows glistened with cold sweat .  He was ready to die . </p>
<p>He turned and shouted,</p>
<p>“I’ll take it from here, so everyone-”</p>
<p>It was in that moment he saw it .  Something flashed from a distance and was flying this way . </p>
<p>Rather, instead of seeing it, it was more like he felt it .  His eyes could not possibly see that attack . </p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>That something obliterated the golem’s head . </p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>Lee Hansoo’s eyes widened .  The headless golem began to falter .  Not noticing, the Hunters pressed their attacks . </p>
<p>“It’s working! The attacks are working!”</p>
<p>“It’s going down!”</p>
<p>“Just a little more!”</p>
<p>They were all too focused on attacking and did not appear to have seen the ‘something’ that had flown over .  Only Lee Hansoo, who stood right before the golem, caught a glimpse of it . </p>
<p>groooooan-</p>
<p>The golem finally went down . </p>
<p>Koong!</p>
<p>Its heavy body threw up a large cloud of dust .  </p>
<p>“Yeaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The Hunters shouted and cheered . </p>
<p>“We did it!”</p>
<p>“We took it down!”</p>
<p>Only Lee Hansoo, who saw what happened, shook his head . </p>
<p>‘No . Our attacks weren’t even working . ’</p>
<p>He quickly searched around the fallen golem . </p>
<p>“Just what the hell blew apart its head?”</p>
<p>Scanning the ground, Lee Hansoo came across the pieces of a broken sword .  Although it had magic power, it was a rather plain steel sword . </p>
<p>‘That thing was something over 10 Hunters were having difficulty taking down… And someone blew its head open by throwing just this?’</p>
<p>He was at a loss for words .  Looking back and forth between the golem’s corpse and the remnants of the sword, Lee Hansoo walked past the cheering Hunters to the direction the sword had flown from . </p>
<p>“Oy!”</p>
<p>There was a soldier standing there . </p>
<p>“Sir? Are you talking to me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you!”</p>
<p>As the large physique of the Hunter walked towards him, the soldier stiffened and gulped .  Such was the pressure Hunters gave off towards ordinary people . </p>
<p>Lee Hansoo held out the sword and asked,</p>
<p>“Did you throw this?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that was-”</p>
<p>The soldier gestured behind him, then stopped . </p>
<p>“Wait, what? There was a Hunter-nim right here . ”</p>
<p>There was no one there .  As the soldier panicked and looked around, Lee Hansoo scratched his head and looked at the sword in his hand again . </p>
<p>‘That power . that destructiveness… Did a high ranking Hunter come here?’</p>
<p>As the man in question had disappeared, he had no way of knowing . </p>
<p>At that time, Jinwoo was on the way home .  He had already turned to leave when he saw the golem falter . </p>
<p>He had taken down the golem .  Normally, a dead magic beast’s drops belonged to the person taking it down .  If he wanted, he could’ve laid a claim on the golem’s corpse . </p>
<p>‘But the problem is that I’d have to prove that I was the one who took it down . ’</p>
<p>Who would believe that it was an E-rank Hunter’s attack that took the golem down? He had no proof; the broken sword or the soldier standing by did not seem like it would be enough .  Even if he was able to prove it, he would have to reveal how he obtained the power to take down a golem . No matter how Jinwoo looked at it, the costs outweigh the benefits . </p>
<p>The unique ability to level-up . </p>
<p>He had no intention of revealing this historical occurrence over a mere golem’s corpse . </p>
<p>‘Regrettable, but what can I do . ’</p>
<p>Well, it wasn’t all for nothing .  No, there was an unexpected boon . A message appeared to him, when he took down the golem:</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve leveled up!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Taking down the golem gave him one level . </p>
<p>‘So I CAN level-up by taking down magic beasts . ’</p>
<p>It was good to know .  This was enough for him, for now . </p>
<p>At the outskirts of the city, there was an old and worn down apartment .  Jinwoo’s house was on the 9th floor of this building . </p>
<p>The house was dark when he entered . </p>
<p>‘Looks like Jinah’s being diligent . ’</p>
<p>His little sister was probably at the library .  There was dinner on top of the table . It was Jinah’s work, having picked up the slack after their mother’s hospitalization few years ago .  There was a small note next to the food, written in cute letters,</p>
<p>“Don’t starve . I’ll check whether or not you ate . ”</p>
<p>Having received the news of his discharge today, she must’ve taken the time to do this, even during her busy schedule .  Jinwoo smiled and sat down at the table, but there was something he wanted to check before eating . </p>
<p>“Status screen . ”</p>

<p>It was a long day .  In that long day, he was able to go all the way to level 18 .  His strength was nearing 50, and his other stats had also risen greatly .  Additionally, he was able to learn the effects of the agility and sense stats . </p>
<p>‘On top of all that, I got a nice dagger with good effects and a good amount of gold… that I can’t spend yet… still . ’</p>
<p>Putting aside the venom that he didn’t want to use…</p>
<p>The attack on the Instant Dungeon was a big success . </p>
<p>-9 . Lizards-</p>
<p>People who left their homes in the dawn of day always made a point to do so quietly .  After all, they didn’t want to wake up their family . Jinah was no different . Think of her sleeping brother, she quietly locked the door and turned to leave for school . </p>
<p><strong>“Going to school?”</strong>.  . </p>
<p>“Eh?!” She abruptly turned to see her brother jogging toward her .  He was wearing a tracksuit and sneakers, his head covered by a hoodie .  It looked like he was coming back from a run . </p>
<p>Jinah stared at her brother with wide open eyes . </p>
<p>“What the . You were awake, oppa?”</p>
<p>“For a while now . Have a good day . ”</p>
<p>“Ah… okay . ”</p>
<p>She watched her brother go inside the house with her head tilted . </p>
<p>‘Huh . To think that there’d be a day where oppa woke up before I did . ’</p>
<p>It was not that Jinwoo was lazy, but Jinah was a diligent student who often got up at the crack of dawn for school, so it was a rare sight for her to see her brother in the morning like this . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it…’</p>
<p>Her brother’s shoulders were a bit wider than she’d remembered . </p>
<p>‘Eh, I must be mistaken . ’</p>
<p>Human bodies were not rubber bands .  They don’t stretch like that in just a few days . </p>
<p> .  . </p>

<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Dungeon Break”: A reminder, a Gate undergoes full opening after 7 days, then a Dungeon Break occurs .  The magic beasts that were normally confined to the inside of the Gate can now leave the Gate, causing destruction and mayhem outside . </p>
<p>[2]: “Dealers” (딜러): The word is in english, “Dealer” .  Korean gaming terminology to refer to “damage dealers”; in the west, more commonly called the “DPS” (damage per second) .  </p>
<p>[3]: Not a mistrans .  Jinwoo forgot the name…</p>
