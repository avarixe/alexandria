<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 60</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside of the Red Gate . </p>
<p>Baek Yoonho’s expression was dark again .  Ahn Sangmin gave a brief explanation of who Sung Jinwoo was, but the Guildmaster was not convinced . </p>
<p>“In the end, it’s just a theory, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . ”</p>
<p>The chief agreed .  After all, there was nothing official on Sung Jinwoo yet . </p>
<p>‘If only the Guildmaster had seen Hunter Sung Jinwoo in person, he would’ve understood . ’</p>
<p>There was something definitely different about Sung Jinwoo .  Unfortunately, Ahn Sangmin was frustrated at the fact that he could not explain this in words .  Baek Yoonho glanced at the Gate . </p>
<p>“Then the person we have to place our hopes in is Kim Cheol . ”</p>
<p>Another voice spoke up,</p>
<p>“There should be no problems with that . ”</p>
<p>Another person had joined Baek Yoonho, Ahn Sangmin and Hyun Gicheol .  The three men turned their gaze towards the newcomer . It was the First Management Division Chief, Joo Sungchan .  He looked over at the three men and continued with confidence,</p>
<p>“We’ve already firmly educated Kim Cheol to prepare for any circumstances . ”</p>
<p>While new recruitment training was the Second Management Division’s job, the First Management Division directly managed the education of A-rank new recruits .  For the talents that would be placed in Baekho’s main raiding party, their starting place would be different in the Guild . At Joo Sungchan’s confidence, Baek Yoonho relaxed a little . </p>
<p>“How was Kim Cheol’s scores?”</p>
<p>“They were very good . His combat abilities weren’t lacking at all compared to our main raiding party members . ”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>A smile finally returned to Baek Yoonho’s face .  Kim Cheol was an A-ranker . An existence among high-rankers that should be treated valuably .  If that man was leading the B-rank Hunters of this Raid, he just might be able to clear this Dungeon .  It was a shame about the C-rank Hunters, but to Baekho, the most important asset was the high-rankers . </p>
<p>‘Thankfully, it looks like Hunter Kim Cheol’s abilities are top notch . ’</p>
<p>The flickering embers of hope lit up again in his chest .  Having reassured his Guildmaster, Joo Sungchan turned to Ahn Sangmin,</p>
<p>“I heard something about a Reawakened E-rank Hunter?”</p>
<p>Joo Sungchan snorted derisively,</p>
<p>“Compared a baseless theory like that, our Hunter Kim Cheol will be infinitely more reliable . ”</p>
<p>Ahn Sangmin’s expression hardened .  The man was being blatantly condescending .  However, Ahn Sangmin did not stoop to arguing with the Joo Sungchan . </p>
<p>‘The results will prove who is right…’</p>
<p>The four men all turned to the Red Gate in unison . </p>
<p>The color of the phenomenon looked like an ill omen of today . </p>
<p>“You . You’re not an E-rank, are you?”</p>
<p>The woman asked brazenly .  Jinwoo replied,</p>
<p>“Then let me ask you something . ”</p>
<p>“Sure . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked over to Kim Cheol’s party .  They were making various plans before heading out . </p>
<p>“All of you, how could you be so calm as new recruits?”</p>
<p>“The first thing they teach us is that ‘Anything can happen in a Dungeon’ . ”</p>
<p>Anything can happen in a Dungeon .  Jinwoo knew this better than anyone else here . </p>
<p>“We’ve all already received some education . Especially that man, Kim Cheol . He’s received a special training . They say he’ll enter Baekho’s main raiding party . ”</p>
<p>They were unafraid just because they had received some education .  Jinwoo was aghast . He realized that there was little difference between them and Han Songyi .  So they sat down in a classroom and were taught a few things, but how useful would it be in a real situation? They were arrogantly puffing out their chest, not knowing the terror of the Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘There is a huge difference between hearing about it in a classroom and experiencing it in real life . ’</p>
<p>In fact, walking around as if they knew the Dungeon, a slightest crack in their confidence would bring down the dam of their arrogance .  It takes time to build up something so fragile but an instant to break it all down . Somehow, Jinwoo was able to see the fate of Kim Cheol’s party .  They looked confident and fine on the outside, but he knew they were all beginners . </p>
<p>“You didn’t answer . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his gaze back to the strange woman . </p>
<p>“My question, you didn’t answer . ”</p>
<p>Was he really an E-rank .  She was a rather persistent woman . </p>
<p>“Why do I have to tell you that?”</p>
<p>Although he had chosen to not answer her question, the woman, Park Heejin, pumped a fist inside her mind .  She had met many people in her life, and she was able to understand their minds . Just now, Jinwoo’s answer was meant to deflect, but it had betrayed the confidence beneath the man . </p>
<p>‘I was right about him!’</p>
<p>There was one other reason why she was sure .  In the past, she had trained with the high-rankers of Baekho and remembered the speed their movements .  But Jinwoo’s hand just now . The hand that caught the arrow was faster than any of Baekho’s high-rankers . </p>
<p>‘I was barely able to understand what happened . ’</p>
<p>She was an athlete who Awakened as a Fighter-class .  She was confident in her visual acuity but was unable to fully see Jinwoo’s movements .  Park Heejin’s eyes were sparkling . </p>
<p>‘At the very least, this man’s an A-ranker . ’</p>
<p>No, perhaps…</p>
<p>“Could you just tell me?”</p>
<p>“No . ”</p>
<p>The casual conversation would stop here .  Jinwoo turned his head . He did not want to continue this back and forth that would go nowhere .  More importantly, Kim Cheol was walking towards them . Jinwoo and Kim Cheol’s eyes met . </p>
<p>“We . ”</p>
<p>Because of his gruff and low voice, no matter what his intentions were, the man’s voice was threatening . </p>
<p>“Will be heading down the road . ”</p>
<p>He was not here to simply let them know of their plans .  Kim Cheol’s eyes were asking him what Jinwoo’s party would do .  A subtle indication of “don’t follow us” was hidden beneath the words . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around then replied,</p>
<p>“We’ll be heading down the forest . ”</p>
<p>“ . Good luck . ”</p>
<p>Well, the ones who’ll need luck are you guys .  Jinwoo swallowed the words . </p>
<p>“You too . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s team headed into the forest .  After watching them disappear in the distance, Kim Cheol let out a laughter he had been holding in . </p>
<p>“Morons . ”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Look over there . ”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol uncrossed his arms and pointed from tree to tree .  It wasn’t just in one place . Wherever he pointed, there was a territorial marking placed by some large beast . </p>
<p>“Th-thats…!”</p>
<p>“Bears . ”</p>
<p>“Ice bear!”</p>
<p>Of the beast type magic beasts, the bear types were especially dangerous .  The marks on the trees signified their territory . The Hunters in Kim Cheol’s team clicked their tongues . </p>
<p>“Tsk . tsk . ”</p>
<p>“Should’ve just waited here . ”</p>
<p>“Looks like that E-ranker’s going to get everyone killed . ”</p>
<p>“What does an E-ranker know?”</p>
<p>Kim Cheol looked towards the forest mockingly . </p>
<p>‘Of course, what does an E-ranker know?’</p>
<p> . Wait . </p>
<p>The smile disappeared from his face . </p>
<p>‘Their team has two C-rankers and even a B-ranker…’</p>
<p>So why did he consider Jinwoo to be their leader? He had not realized this until now .  Kim Cheol shook his head,</p>
<p>‘ . Well, whatever . ’</p>
<p>They’ll all be dead soon anyways .  Kim Cheol decided to focus on himself and put the weaklings out of his mind .  The dead are dead, but the living should strive to live . Kim Cheol turned to the road and spoke with a strength in his voice,</p>
<p>“Let’s go . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo walked in front of the group .  However, he had only taken few steps when Park Heejin ran ahead of him and blocked his way . </p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo did not hide his annoyance and crossed his arms .  “Choose your next words carefully” was the message . Reading the mood, Park Heejin lowered her voice,</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I have to say this . ”</p>
<p>She gestured at the trees around them,</p>
<p>“Do you see those?”</p>
<p>A large claw mark on a tree . </p>
<p>“And there . Over there too!”</p>
<p>In fact, it was harder to find an unmarked tree . </p>
<p>“The bears’ territorial marks are all over the place! This entire forest must be the home to bear magic beasts!”</p>
<p>In the animal kingdom, dogs and cats were weak compared to tigers and lions .  It was the same with magic beasts . A dog type or a cat type magic beasts were far weaker than a tiger type or a lion type .  And what about a bear type? Doubly so when it was a polar bear, a top predator among the animals . And right now, Jinwoo had lead his team into the territory of those terrifying magic beasts .  It was understandable that Park Heejin was mad . </p>
<p>“We have to go back right now! Before the magic beasts come!”</p>
<p>Tsk tsk . </p>
<p>Jinwoo clicked his tongue . </p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Park Heejin had expected one of three responses from Jinwoo: anger, surprise or acceptance .  Her expectations were off . Instead of acting like the one at fault, Jinwoo was instead looking down at her condescendingly . </p>
<p>‘Why-why is he looking at me like that?’</p>
<p>Feeling embarrassed, Park Heejin’s face turned red . </p>
<p>“W-What!”</p>
<p>Her voice was raised again .  Jinwoo sighed deeply and opened his mouth,</p>
<p>“Since it’s hard to find an unmarked tree, that means there are a lot of ice bears, right?”</p>
<p>“E-exactly, so we have to quickly-”</p>
<p>“That’s why we’re heading into the forest . ”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Park Heejin’s eyes were wide open . </p>
<p>‘Does she still not understand?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo decided to take the time to explain,</p>
<p>“In the forest, all we have to worry about are the ice bears . ”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Park Heejin finally understood the meaning of Jinwoo’s actions .  If this forest was a home to many ice bears, that also meant that there was nothing here that threatened the ice bears .  It meant they didn’t have to worry about any magic beasts stronger than ice bears . </p>
<p>‘Why didn’t I think of that…’</p>
<p>She felt embarrassed at yelling knowingly at the man .  She could not raise her reddened face . Jinwoo clicked a tongue in his mind again .  One of the scariest things about a Dungeon was that you did not know what kind of an enemy waited around the corner .  Knowing the enemy was half the battle after all . And in this forest, the information about the enemy was all over the place . </p>
<p>‘Magic beasts in the form of a bear . ’</p>
<p>No matter how strong these ice bears were, Jinwoo was sure that they were weaker than the ice elves earlier .  It was because the elves’ clothing was made of bear pelts . That’s why he selected the forest . His plan was to level-up here while keeping an eye out for Kim Cheol’s team and the White Walkers .  That was the safest path he had determined . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stared suspiciously at Park Heejin,</p>
<p>“Why is your face so red?”</p>
<p>Her face was really red .  She spoke with her head lowered,</p>
<p>“I . I’m cold . ”</p>
<p>“Whew-”</p>
<p>With a deep sigh, Jinwoo pulled up the shop and purchased several articles of clothing, made out of thick fur, and some winter-use shoes . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Warm Fur Coat</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: N/A</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Junk</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>It’s really warm . </strong>.   </p>
<p>Cost: 10 gold</p>

<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Warm Boots</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: N/A</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Junk</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>It’s really warm . </strong>.   </p>
<p>Cost: 10 gold</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Fur coat and boots, ten gold each . ’</p>
<p>Compared to items with special effects, ordinary use items like these were not expensive .  Compared to his gold, they were rather cheap . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Current Gold: 431,930</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Still, to think that I would actually purchase junk items…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo confirmed the transaction .  Since he could not discriminate in their current situation, he spent a 100 gold to buy a set for each of the 5 Hunters . </p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>Five sets of fur coats and boots appeared out of thin air in front of his feet .  Other than Jinwoo, every one of his party members opened their eyes wide in shock . </p>
<p>“What the!”</p>
<p>“W-what the hell? Spatial magic?”</p>
<p>Park Heejin was also shocked and raised her head .  Ignoring their gasps, Jinwoo calmly spoke,</p>
<p>“Everyone, pick one up and put it on . ”</p>
<p>And with that, Jinwoo reached for the nearest fur coat when he felt a tug on his sleeves . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his head to face Han Songyi .  The girl gathered courage and spoke with difficulty,</p>
<p>“Ah-ahjussi, what are you? The arrow from earlier… And now this weird magic…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo furrowed his brows .  If he let this continue, it would only be a headache going forward . </p>
<p>‘Ok, let’s nip this in the bud right now . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo sternly spoke, “I brought you here, so I’ll be responsible for your protection . But . ”</p>
<p>His voice lowered, “You can’t ask me any questions . ”</p>
<p>He raised his head and stared at Park Heejin and the other Hunters . </p>
<p>“That goes for all of you as well . Do not ask or request anything of me . ”</p>
<p>He continued, “If you don’t like it, you are more than free to leave . I won’t stop you . ”</p>
<p>Truthfully, the two other male Hunters had followed the B-rank Hunter Park Heejin up until now .  But looking back and forth between the warm gear and Jinwoo, they vigorously nodded . </p>
