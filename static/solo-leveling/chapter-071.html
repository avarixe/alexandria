<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 71</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho was shocked . </p>
<p>‘ . Red Gate?’</p>
<p>Why would that be brought up here? Because of how much attention it was getting in the media, Yoo Jinho was well aware of the incident .  However, he was not sure why his father was bringing it up in this meeting . </p>
<p>‘And that man…’</p>
<p>The so-called survivor of the incident .  The press was looking for anyone related to the incident with fervor .  How was that man even called to this place? Questions piled up in Yoo Jinho’s mind .  Watching him, Yoo Myunghan slowly opened his mouth,</p>
<p>“It appears that you are not aware . ”</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>Putting aside the confused Yoo Jinho, the chairman turned to the nervous looking Go Myunghwan . </p>
<p>“Hunter-nim . ”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Please inform my son who was there on that day, other than the Baekho’s new recruits . ”</p>
<p>“Understood . ”</p>
<p>Go Myunghwan turned to Yoo Jinho .  Looking at the man, Yoo Jinho still showed confusion on his face . </p>
<p>“There was a young female Hunter, about the age of a highschooler, and-”</p>
<p>‘A young female Hunter?’</p>
<p>Up until that point, Yoo Jinho could not have dreamt of the name Go Myunghwan would say next,</p>
<p>“Sung Jinwoo-ssi . ”</p>
<p>sink</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho could almost hear his heart sinking to his stomach . </p>
<p>‘H-hyungnim was at the Red Gate incident?’</p>
<p>How could this have happened? Yoo Jinho’s mind fell into chaos . But then the young man remembered something,</p>
<p>‘Wait, few days ago…’</p>
<p>Han Songyi, who had completely ignored hyungnim in the past, was sharing a friendly conversation with the man . </p>
<p>“What was the female Hunter’s name?”</p>
<p>“It’s Ms . Han Songyi . ”</p>
<p>My god .  Yoo Jinho’s mouth opened wide .  To think that this was the secret of hyungnim and Han Songyi’s relationship . </p>
<p>‘That means…’</p>
<p>The “unknown helper” theorized all over the news is… As if finishing his thought, Go Myunghwan continued,</p>
<p>“It was because of Sung Jinwoo-ssi that Ms . Han Songyi and our Baekho members were able to leave the Red Gate with our lives . ”</p>
<p>‘Oh my god…’</p>
<p>Hyungnim, just what were you doing over there .  Yoo Jinho was half surprised and half happy at hearing his hyungnim’s name .  The young man forgot about his father in front of him and brazenly asked,</p>
<p>“What happened in the Red Gate?”</p>
<p>Go Myunghwan looked to his side for permission .  Yoo Myunghan nodded . The Hunter was already itching to go off into details, so the man happily explained everything that had happened in the Red Gate,</p>
<p>“Well, where to start…”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho listened with his eyes sparkling . </p>
<p>“We were flustered at first, when we heard that two E-rank Hunters would be joining in our training .  But…”</p>
<p>Go Myunghwan began regaling the tales that happened like a child showing off his new toy to his friends .  However, he was not the only one excited by the tale,</p>
<p>“An A-rank Hunter?!”</p>
<p>“I know, right! He just slapped him like pow! And Kim Cheol just went down like boom!”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Everytime he heard a new accomplishment of hyungnim, Yoo Jinho’s heart beat faster .  </p>
<p>‘As expected of hyungnim . ’</p>
<p>Taking down the high-level magic beasts was nothing .  But to think that he could knock out an A-rank Hunter in one blow .  The fact that that man was his hyungnim filled Yoo Jinho with awe and pride .  Go Myunghwan continued his story,</p>
<p>“-Then dozens of ice elves appeared out of thin air . I really thought we were done for then, but-”</p>
<p>Was it because they were so focused on the story? The time passed by quickly .  The tale of the Red Gate was not a short story, but in no time, Go Myunghwan reached the end .  The man spoke a little too excitedly,</p>
<p>“It was something impossible . Sung Jinwoo-ssi was the savior of everyone there . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho nodded along without realizing .  He fully understood Go Myunghwan’s feelings .  He himself was saved by hyungnim several times . </p>
<p>“And to think that we couldn’t tell the story of our savior! It was hard for me to accept Baekho’s decision on this matter . Fortunately, the chairman contacted me and-”</p>
<p>Yoo Myunghan cut off Go Myunghwan at the right time,</p>
<p>“Hunter Go Myunghwan-nim . ”</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>“I think that’s good enough . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, I apologize . I got a little too excited . ”</p>
<p>Go Myunghwan slightly bowed his head in embarrassment .  Yoo Myunghan turned back to his son,</p>
<p>“And when I investigated Hunter Sung Jinwoo, an unexpected name appeared . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Myunghan pointed to a name on a document in front of him .  The man’s finger was on Yoo Jinho’s name . The document was one of the raiding reports the young Hunter had handed to his father in the beginning .  The finger slid over to a second name on the document, Sung Jinwoo . </p>
<p>Raid Leader Yoo Jinho .  Raid Member Sung Jinwoo . </p>
<p>The evidence was clear . </p>
<p>‘He got me…’</p>
<p>The fact that he had borrowed a powerful Hunter’s abilities for his Guildmaster license plan was found out .  Yoo Jinho’s expression hardened . </p>
<p>“The fact that Hunter Sung Jinwoo’s help was great in your plans to obtain the Guildmaster license . Do you deny it?”</p>
<p>“ . No, sir . ”</p>
<p>“Do you have anything else to say?”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>The road ahead looked bleak to the young man .  The moment hyungnim’s involvement in the plan was revealed, it became impossible to convince his father that he was worthy of Yoojin Guild . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>His father continued to look at him with a fierce gaze .  In the past, Yoo Jinho would’ve lost all strength before that gaze . </p>
<p>‘But . ’</p>
<p>He could not back off like this .  For the first time in his life, Yoo Jinho gathered the courage to stand up to his father .  The young man bowed his head and raised his voice,</p>
<p>“Could you please leave Yoojin Guild to me, father?”</p>
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>At the cool reply, Yoo Jinho raised his head . </p>
<p>“I’ll leave Yoojin Guild to you . ”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>“You said it yourself . It’s too risky to leave the Guild to an outsider . With your existence, is there a need for us to take on unnecessary risk?”</p>
<p>“B-but, I tried to deceive you, father-”</p>
<p>“So what . Did you think I would scold you and chase you away?”</p>
<p>Was he mistaken? His father’s face remained stern; his mouth closed in a straight line .  But Yoo Jinho felt like his father was smiling . </p>
<p>“If you had carelessly entered these Dungeons without a plan, perhaps I would’ve done so . I do not recall raising a fool for a son . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho felt his face becoming hot . </p>
<p>‘If I never met hyungnim, I would be yelled at and sent away by father right now . ’</p>
<p>Well, he would’ve probably died before that .  Yoo Jinho sighed in relief in his mind . </p>
<p>“However, I have a condition . ”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir . ”</p>
<p>“This Hunter Sung Jinwoo… Could you bring him to Yoojin Guild?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho’s eyes opened wide,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim to our Guild?”</p>
<p>‘Did he just say hyungnim?’</p>
<p>A light flashed across Yoo Myunghan’s eyes for a split second . </p>
<p>“Yes . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho could not reply easily,</p>
<p>‘Argh…’</p>
<p>The young man knew he had to appear confident before his father right now .  However, the target in question was hyungnim . All he could do is ask and hope for the best .  So, he spoke truthfully to his father,</p>
<p>“I’m not sure . ”</p>
<p>“Good . There would’ve been no point to a condition if it was that easy . ”</p>
<p>Chairman Yoo Myunghan drank some water then wiped his mouth with a handkerchief . </p>
<p>“If you fail, I will turn the Guild over to your brother . How about it, will you give it a go?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho’s face filled with determination . </p>
<p>‘I’ve worked hard for this opportunity…’</p>
<p>If he walked away now, he would not be able to raise his head in front of hyungnim, who had helped him until the very end .  Yoo Jinho spoke with a serious look in his eyes,</p>
<p>“Yes, I will try . ”</p>
<p>“Good . ”</p>
<p>With his father’s last word, the deal between father and son was complete .  Yoo Myunghan silently nodded to dismiss his son, and Yoo Jinho bid his goodbyes and left .  Yoo Myunghan removed the handkerchief from his mouth; the man had difficulty hiding the smile on his face . </p>
<p>‘That brat…’</p>
<p>To think that he would ask for the Yoojin Guild .  He had a rough idea of what Yoo Jinho wanted when his son asked for this meeting, but it was beyond Yoo Myunghan’s expectations that his son would come with such determination . </p>
<p>‘As expected, the tiger’s son is a tiger . ’</p>
<p>The smile on Yoo Myunghan’s face slowly widened . </p>
<p>‘Holy shit! THE Chairman Yoo Myunghan is smiling!’</p>
<p>Go Myunghwan was beyond shocked .  The chairman’s nickname was “Pokerface” .  Whether something good or bad happened, the man was famous for maintaining his stern and fierce expression .  Sensing Go Myunghwan’s awed stare, Yoo Myunghan turned to his side and asked,</p>
<p>“Hunter-nim, do you have anything else to say?”</p>
<p>At the sudden question, Go Myunghwan hastily shook his head,</p>
<p>“N-no, sir . ”</p>
<p> . 47, 48, 49, 50 . </p>
<p>Jinwoo climbed toward the upper floor with a terrifying speed . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated a Mid-level Demon . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>However, looking at the piling up experience points and souls every time he defeated a demon, Jinwoo did not feel tired . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Collected Demon Souls: 4,388/ 10,000</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Not even halfway, huh?’</p>
<p>He felt like he had hunted an endless horde of demons here, but the wall known as 10,000 was still very high .  What about his level?</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Level: 69</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He had gained two more levels after a day .  It definitely had slowed down, but was still fast compared to the rate of soul collecting .  Even now, he continued to gain experience points . </p>
<p>“Kkieeeek!”</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong> . Mid-level Demon . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve earned 300 experience points . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve earned 1 Demon Soul . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Whew-!”</p>
<p>After taking down the last demon in front of him, Jinwoo stretched his back and looked around .  Between the Shadow Soldiers standing at attention, countless corpses of mid-level demons were scattered about . </p>
<p>clap</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled and put his hands together . </p>
<p>“Good job, everyone . ”</p>
<p>The soldiers that fought hard returned to his shadow .  While they could be used to collect magic cores in normal Dungeons, in here, only Jinwoo was able to collect the drops . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to acquire it?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>After all, only he could respond to the System’s messages . </p>
<p>‘This part’s a bit inconvenient . ’</p>
<p>And so, if the number of demons was low, Jinwoo would take care of them on his own .  Only against a larger group, were the soldiers summoned . After each battle, he went from corpse to corpse, stretching his hand toward the light and collecting drops . </p>
<p>‘What was so fun about this that Jinho kept volunteering?’</p>
<p>Remembering his dongsaeng, Jinwoo smiled as he continued to work .  </p>
<p>There was one more inconvenience here .  In the Demon Castle, Shadow Extraction was impossible .  The low-level and mid-level demons he fought did not give off the black smoke that indicated a soldier could be raised . </p>
<p>‘Even when I stare at the corpses, all I get is-’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The mana is contaminated . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>It’s not a possible target for Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The message that told him extraction was impossible due to contaminated mana . </p>
<p>‘Well, what could I do?’</p>
<p>With a disappointed feeling, Jinwoo went from corpse to corpse and piled up the drop messages . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve found 29 “Mid-level Demon’s Horns”</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to acquire them all?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Jinwoo smiled widely,</p>
<p>‘Of course!’</p>
<p>Looking at the items that piled up on the ground out of thin air, Jinwoo forgot about the disappointment regarding Shadow Extraction . </p>
<p>‘Nothing I could use . ’</p>
<p>Then everything has to go! The mass sale of junk items in the past few days had massively increased his hoard . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Current Gold: 914,690,772</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Damn! Looking at the amount of gold he had amassed, Jinwoo was satisfied once more .  His funds for the System’s shop had risen above 900 million . </p>
<p>‘Makes sense . A single demon’s horn is about 200,000, and I’ve hunted 4,000 of them . ’</p>
<p>And adding the other random items sold here and there, the gold piled up with terrifying speed . </p>
<p>‘Should I purchase an S-rank weapon or an armor?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo shook his head .  He didn’t particularly feel the need right now and did not want to forcefully spend gold . </p>
<p>‘I’m sure I’ll have a need for it someday . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo closed the inventory and dusted off his hands .  The area was roughly cleared . He had long since obtained the entry permit for the 51st Floor .  All that was left to do is head over to the magic elevator…</p>
<p>Jinwoo moved his gaze to the pillar of light .  Guarding the magic circle was a single giant demon surrounded by multiple high-level demons .  Jinwoo looked above the giant demon’s head . Its name was floating in the usual place, in black letters:</p>
<p>‘Overlord of the Lower Floors, Volkhan of Avarice’ [1]</p>
<p>The demon had a giant muscular body that looked like it weight several dozen, no, several hundred tons .  In its hands was a terrifyingly large club . Still, Jinwoo smiled,</p>
<p>‘So that’s the halfway boss?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo had no bad memories when it came to the bosses of the Instant Dungeons .  They had always given a large amount of experience points and dropped good items .  Compared to the boss-level magic beasts that often gave little reward, boss-level monsters were practically gift boxes .  The Hunter wondered just what this thing would drop . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled as he gulped in anticipation . </p>
<p>.  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Overlord of the Lower Floors, Volkhan of Avarice” (하층의 지배자, 탐욕스런 볼칸): Wew, long name .  “Lower level/floor” 하층 + “ruler/overlord/dominator” 지배자 . “Greedy/Avarice” 탐욕스런 + proper name (ball 볼 + khan 칸) .  Note, the title for “overlord” 지배자, is the exact same word as “Ruler” from “Ruler’s Hands” skill (지배자의 손길), but I am purposely using a different word here . Don’t ask why . </p>
