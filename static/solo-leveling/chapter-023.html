<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 23</p>
<p>With the eyes of a predator sizing up prey, Jinwoo moved his gaze from one Hunter to the next . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok gulped . </p>
<p>The fact that a dagger had appeared out of nowhere in his hand was surprising, but what shocked him even more was Park Joontae’s death . </p>
<p>‘How did an E-rank kill a D-rank in one hit?’</p>
<p>Regardless of what trick he used, he could no longer be underestimated .  They had to become focused . Hwang Dongseok cast a glance to his side, ‘give him another one . ’</p>
<p>Jo Gyuhwan nodded .  He would not make the same mistake! The determined hands once more gathered light in them . </p>
<p>But before he could fire the arrow of light, Jinwoo appeared before Jo Gyuhwan . </p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Jo Gyuhwan’s mouth opened wide in surprise .  Jinwoo’s eyes were fierce . </p>
<p>‘First, the Mage-class Hunter with strong firepower but weak constitution . ’</p>
<p>He had already made all the calculations . </p>
<p>The dagger embedded into Jo Gyuhwan’s neck . </p>
<p>stab!</p>
<p>cough!</p>
<p>Jo Gyuhwan grabbed his neck and fell . </p>
<p>thud</p>
<p>“Kill him!”</p>
<p>“Ahh!!!”</p>
<p>The man’s death signaled the start of the fight; all the Hunters came at Jinwoo .  Jinwoo sharpened his nerves and focused on each of their movements . </p>
<p>Sound disappeared, and time slowed down . </p>
<p>The power of the agility stat, raised to 38 points, began to show off . </p>
<p>He blocked and dodged the torrent of swords, spears and arrows that were coming at him . </p>
<p>The Hunters’ eyes widened,</p>
<p>‘How, how is an E-ranker moving like this?!’</p>
<p>‘He’s too fast!’</p>
<p>‘I can’t hit him!’</p>
<p>Their faces became pale . </p>
<p>Speed was relative .  To their eyes, Jinwoo’s movements were terrifyingly swift . </p>
<p>Jinwoo weaved between the Hunters, stabbing them one by one . </p>

<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>“What, what the hell is he?!”</p>
<p>“Uwaaaak!”</p>
<p>All around the room, the Hunters’ screams spilled forth .  Five of the surrounding enemies had already fallen . </p>

<p>Jinwoo faced the last man remaining . </p>
<p>The hairy man with a large physique, Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>With a determined face, he threw aside his shield and gathered his energy . </p>
<p>“Waaaaaah!!!”</p>
<p>He kicked the ground and charged . </p>
<p>boom boom boom boom!</p>
<p>As he ran, he thought to himself .  He was a Tanker who shone in the upper echelon of C-rankers .  The target was probably a Dealer . His movements were fast, but there was no way that he would have the power to go through his body, reinforced with the ‘Strengthen’[1] skill . </p>
<p>‘You cannot give me a mortal wound with a mere dagger!’</p>
<p>The one who would be destroyed in their clash will be Sung Jinwoo!</p>
<p>He tackled with his shoulder as the distance closed . </p>
<p>“Strengthen!”</p>
<p>The room suddenly spun around him, and the Dungeon’s ceiling appeared before his eyes . </p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>His head shook and he felt a great pain on his neck and back .  He tried to rise but his body did not listen . The struggling Hwang Dongseok sprawled on the ground . </p>
<p>“cough!”</p>
<p>Blood came out of his mouth . </p>
<p>‘Did… did he just throw me?’</p>
<p>He, Hwang Dongseok, just lost in power?</p>
<p>In a contest of strength?</p>
<p>“A mere E-rank trash like you…”</p>
<p>He realized his mistake .  5 C-ranks and 4 D-ranks were defeated in an instant .  There was no way Jinwoo was an E-ranker . </p>
<p>Jinwoo stood next to Hwang Dongseok .  The man could not even move his body . The results of the fight was clear .  If this was a competitive sport, this is where it would end . </p>
<p>It was not going to end here . </p>
<p>“W-wait . ”</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok raised a feeble hand . </p>
<p>“P-please, let me live . If you want money, I’ll give you money . Plenty of it, just let me live…”</p>
<p>“Three times . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo replied with ice in his voice,</p>
<p>“Aren’t you embarrassed to ask someone you tried to kill three times for mercy?”</p>
<p>One .  Through blocking the entrance . </p>
<p>Two .  Through ordering Yoo Jinho . </p>
<p>Three .  Through Jo Gyuhwan’s magic . </p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok had made three attempts on Jinwoo’s life, discounting the fight just now . </p>
<p>Give and Take . </p>
<p>After returning alive from the temple, Jinwoo had made this creed .  </p>
<p>To give as much was given, and to take as much was taken . </p>
<p>Whether it was good or bad . </p>
<p>There would be no compromise . </p>
<p>Realizing he could not beg for mercy, Hwang Dongseok opened his eyes wide and foamed at the mouth,</p>
<p>“You, you think you’ll just get away with this?! Do you know who my little brother-”</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>Hwang Dongseok could not continue with his crushed neck . </p>
<p>His eyes rolled back to reveal their whites . </p>
<p>ring~</p>

<p>Enemies dealt with: 8</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The quest was finally over . </p>
<p>“Phew-”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s lengthy sigh carried many meanings .  He took his hand off Hwang Dongseok’s throat and looked at it .  Although it was a one-sided battle, his hands were shaking at the fact that he had just taken eight lives . </p>
<p>‘Is this really okay?’</p>
<p>He placed the hand on his chest and felt his heart . </p>
<p>ba dum ba dum ba dum </p>
<p>It was beating normally . </p>
<p>‘I wonder…’</p>
<p>From the day that he had returned from the underground temple, perhaps the System wasn’t the only change within Jinwoo .  But his worries were brief, interrupted by the familiar electronic tone . </p>
<p>ring~</p>

<p>He had expected this .  Without delay, he confirmed the rewards . </p>
<p>“Verify . ”</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘10 stat points and even a new skill?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes widened at the incredible reward .  Putting the attribute points aside, the idea of a new skill piqued his interest greatly . </p>
<p>‘If I didn’t have ‘sprint’ while fighting the spider…’</p>
<p>The reason he was able to defeat the boss was thanks to a skill .  Their effectiveness in battles could not be understated . There was reason why Runestones were insanely expensive . </p>
<p>Jinwoo immediately checked the ‘Bloodlust’ skill .  </p>
<p>‘Check Reward 3 . ’</p>
<p>ring~</p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Although temporary, it had a very desirable power to lower every attribute of a target .  Jinwoo was sure it would not work against targets with high resistance, but to the ones that didn’t, they would become food before his hands .  On top of that, it was able to affect multiple targets . </p>
<p>‘It’s amazing . ’</p>
<p>As the penalty was great, so was the reward . </p>
<p>‘Well… it makes sense, right?’</p>
<p>His life was on the line this time .  Not only that-</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around .  He frowned at the scene of massacre .  He had witnessed the death of many Hunters before, but he was still not used to the sight of their corpses .  This was the result that the quest wanted . Compared to the number of lives he had taken, the reward now seemed small .  Not that he would’ve been able to avoid all this, even without the quest . </p>
<p>‘There’s no end to man’s greed…’</p>
<p>He shook his head . </p>
<p>The cave shook again . </p>
<p>Shaaaaake!</p>
<p>It was a lot stronger than before .  It was time to leave the Dungeon . </p>
<p>But there was a loose end to tidy up before leaving . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho . </p>
<p>Jinwoo turned his gaze towards the young man .  The pitiful form of Yoo Jinho, frozen from fear, cast his eyes down at Jinwoo’s gaze . </p>
<p>‘What to do with him…’</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn’t thinking of killing Yoo Jinho .  There was no reason or need . </p>
<p>But if everything that had happened here leaked, it would become very bothersome . </p>
<p>‘Let’s thoroughly ensure his silence . ’</p>
<p>As if on cue, Yoo Jinho ran forward and knelt before Jinwoo,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim! Please let me live!”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo realized this would be easier than he thought . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho trembled heavily .  His face was completely pale .  After all, he had just watched Jinwoo slaughter eight people .  One of the most powerful weapon to rule over a person was ‘fear’ .  So Jinwoo decided to use that to his advantage . </p>
<p>“Why should I?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo swore he heard Yoo Jinho’s heart literally sink . </p>
<p>‘Was that too much?’</p>
<p>“M-money- if you n-need money, I can ask my-”</p>
<p>. <strong>“What are you taking me for?!”</strong>. </p>
<p>Jinwoo flared with a genuine anger .  He lived his entire life in poverty, but he had no intentions to use someone as a hostage for money .  If he did that, he would be no different than Hwang Dongseok . </p>
<p>“I-I apologize . ”</p>
<p>If Yoo Jinho was not shaking in fear, he would’ve smacked him on the back of his head .  But if he did, it felt like the young man would keel over with a heart attack, so Jinwoo stayed his hand . </p>
<p>Seeing Jinwoo’s hardened expression, Yoo Jinho gulped . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it, he also refused Hwang Dongseok’s offer of money… Is he a man who abandoned material wants and walks a path of flesh and blood?’</p>
<p>The image of Jinwoo in Yoo Jinho’s head became stranger .  But it was too early to make that call,</p>
<p>‘Then why did he collect the magic cores?’</p>
<p>Just moments earlier, Jinwoo was cutting open the spider’s stomach to grab every last bit of the magic cores .  A source of great power, the magic cores had many uses beyond just crafting magic items . But to a Hunter, they were no different than money . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho’s head spun with thought . </p>
<p>‘Then it must be that!’</p>
<p>It was the price of blood .  The reason that he dirtied his hands to look through the corpse was because he had fought the spider boss for it .  He would have no mercy towards those who went against him, but he would also have nothing to do with that which was not earned with sweat and blood .  A true patron of effort[3]!</p>
<p>‘To think that I tried to buy such hyungnim’s mercy with money . Of course he would be mad at me . ’</p>
<p>Then, what he needed now was not ‘his father’s money’, but a ‘worthiness’ to spare his life .  He glanced over at Jinwoo’s face, but the man still appeared to be mad . </p>
<p>Yoo Jinho quickly spoke,</p>
<p>“Hyungnim . If you spare me, I’ll turn over all the income from this Dungeon to hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>As he expected, Jinwoo was interested . </p>
<p>“Think about it, hyungnim . If nine of the ten people died in this Dungeon, and hyungnim took home all the profits, anyone would be suspicious, no?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho was sure that Jinwoo was a false ranker .  Not only that, a powerful false ranker who enjoyed killing! A person like that could not afford the attention of others falling on him . </p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“On the other hand, if hyungnim and I leave here together, according to the contract, all of the magic cores would become mine . Even with the eight others dead, since there was no benefit to hyungnim, nobody would suspect you . ”</p>
<p>Of course, nobody would suspect Yoo Jinho either .  He was the son of one of the country’s most powerful chairman .  The magic cores wouldn’t be of any worth to him . </p>
<p>“Of course, the money would belong to you, hyungnim . It’s the ‘fair price’ for killing Hwang Dongseok’s party and saving my life . ”</p>

<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: “Strengthen” (강화): lit . “reinforce/strengthen” </p>
<p>[2]: “Bloodlust” (살기): “murder/murderous” 살 + “energy/spirit” 기 .  Directly translates to “bloodthirst/bloodlust” . Also could be “Killing Intent” . </p>
<p>[3]: “patron of effort” (피의 수도자): My apologies, my translation is actually completely different than the original korean .  The literal translation would be “ascetic of blood”, which I had felt did not convey the meaning of the passage in English .  Jinho’s image of Jinwoo is basically that he only takes what he has earned . In Korean culture, “blood” carries a very common symbolic meaning of effort, hence the “ascetic of blood” title .  </p>
