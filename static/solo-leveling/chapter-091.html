<h3>Chapter 91: Chapter 91</h3> 
<p>'Summons??'. </p>
<p>The first thing Cha Hae-In thought of was summoning when she saw the Shadow Soldiers . However, there were simply too many of them to say that this was the result of summoning magic </p>
<p>The thing was, the mage-type Hunters specialising in summoning magic could only control one, or two at a push . If one could control two, then the treatment one received improved greatly, and she hadn't yet heard of anyone capable of controlling three or more summon creatures </p>
<p>However . </p>
<p>Just how many of them were here?!. </p>
<p>'This makes no sense!'. </p>
<p>One man summoned over 100 in one go . And, he didn't even need a lot of time to summon them, too . No, he only needed a moment to summon dozens and dozens in one go </p>
<p>'I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it with my own two eyes . '. </p>
<p>She might be one of the top-ten ranked Hunters in South Korea, but another Hunter's ability had managed to leave her totally speechless now </p>
<p>However . </p>
<p>'This isn't the time for me to stand around like this . '. </p>
<p>Her gaze immediately shifted past the Shadow Soldiers and locked onto the raid team . Their complexions were not good at all . Some of them were squatting on the ground as if they no longer had any energy left </p>
<p>Didn't matter what the identity of the man named Seong Jin-Woo was, didn't matter what kind of ability he possessed – her priority lay with lending him aid by taking care of these High Orcs right away </p>
<p>The results of her thought process might be simple, but she was incredibly quick to put them into action . Cha Hae-In tightened her grip on the 'weapon' in her hands and took a step towards the High Orcs </p>
<p>However, it happened then </p>
<p>Her eyes met Jin-Woo's . And his eyes were telling her in no uncertain terms </p>
<p>… . That it was not necessary; that she shouldn't interfere </p>
<p>That she should just observe from the sidelines </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In couldn't understand why </p>
<p>'But, how come ?'. </p>
<p>She could easily tell that Seong Jin-Woo was capable of controlling countless summons . However, there were just as many High Orcs standing, and there was also the boss possessing greater power, too </p>
<p>Because he had to summon that many creatures, and he had to maintain them constantly too, his magic energy reserve should be running empty by now . Yet . </p>
<p>'What is he trying to do on his own?'. </p>
<p>She was puzzled, sure, but in the end, Cha Hae-In lowered her weapon . It wasn't because the so-called weapon just so happened to be a pickaxe she borrowed from the mining team . No, she became curious with what the Hunter named Seong Jin-Woo would do against the army of High Orcs, instead </p>
<p>Expectations </p>
<p>Her cool-headed reasoning and her expectation had a fight in her mind, and the latter achieved a resounding victory . For some reason, her heart began palpitating faster now </p>
<p>'Whew, that's a relief . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo inwardly breathed a sigh of relief after seeing Cha Hae-In's response . Seriously, the real thing was about to begin, so it wouldn't do for some interference to suddenly pop out, now would it?. </p>
<p>Heck, he even had to let the poor Sohn Ki-Hoon go through that crap until the very last moment humanly possible, just for a chance to monopolise all the monsters in here </p>
<p>'Well, he's the kind of a guy who'd try to fight alongside if he has some energy left still . '. </p>
<p>That was why he only acted the moment Sohn Ki-Hoon let go of his sword . Even though he had to suppress his urge to rush forward and kick the head of that d*mn Shaman </p>
<p>It was all for this moment </p>
<p>'As expected of a quick-witted woman . '. </p>
<p>What a relief it was that Cha Hae-In turned out to be a smart girl . She backed off without him needing to raise his voice, after all . Jin-Woo turned his attention back to his front while a deep smile formed on his face </p>
<p>"Shadows!". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo loud yell reverberating within the boss room prompted the shadows to take the battle stance all at once, not one of them deviating from the formation ever so slightly </p>
<p>Clack!!. </p>
<p>Only a moment later, an eerie silence filled up the chamber </p>
<p>The thing that broke this silence was the single word Jin-Woo threw out while pointing at the High Orc Shaman </p>
<p>"Go . ". </p>
<p>With that, over a hundred Shadow Soldiers rushed towards the cowering group of High Orc warriors </p>
<p>RUMBLE---!!!. </p>
<p>The black soldiers and their controlled march shook the ground, the cavern, and even the eyes of all those witnessing this scene </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Woo Jin-Cheol was running breathlessly </p>
<p>"Pant, pant, pant ". </p>
<p>He ran so hard that he now tasted sweetness in his mouth </p>
<p>He bent over and tried to catch his breaths, before raising his torso up – only to spot a woman with a short hairstyle standing near the entrance of the boss room . He immediately recognised who she was </p>
<p>'Cha Hae-in '. </p>
<p>Where would you find a female Hunter possessing an aura like hers?. </p>
<p>'… . However, why is she standing still like that?'. </p>
<p>Woo Jin-Cheol found it strange that she didn't try to participate in the battle and simply stood by, so he quickly walked up next to her </p>
<p>And it was at that point he got to see clearly the situation inside the boss room </p>
<p>"This What is this?". </p>
<p>Soldiers wearing jet-black armour were one-sidedly massacring the supposedly-powerful monsters, also known as High Orc warriors </p>
<p>"K-kuwaaahk!!". </p>
<p>"Kiiahk!". </p>
<p>"Kueehhk!!". </p>
<p>The pitiful screams of the High Orcs even managed to deafen Woo Jin-Cheol's hearing </p>
<p>Also, he might have been less shocked if there were only human-shaped soldiers present . But then again, just what were those nonsensically huge black bears with smoke coming out of them, as well as High Orcs kitted out in various black-coloured armours?. </p>
<p>"Been a while, Chief Woo Jin-Cheol . ". </p>
<p>"Ah, yes, miss . It's been a while . but, what are they? They don't seem to be simple monsters ". </p>
<p>"They are summons that man called out . ". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In greeted Woo Jin-Cheol first before pointing at Jin-Woo in the distance </p>
<p>Woo Jin-Cheol quickly took his sunglasses off and stared at Jin-Woo, now standing in the middle of the battlefield . While wielding two shortswords that looked like daggers, he was busy destroying the formation of the High Orcs </p>
<p>'No matter how I see it, doesn't he look like a top-ranked melee-type Hunter?'. </p>
<p>However, he could even use summoning magic, too?. </p>
<p>And, sure enough </p>
<p>When Jin-Woo's lips moved a little, dozens more summons rose up from the ground </p>
<p>"Oh, my god!". </p>
<p>Woo Jin-Cheol's jaw fell to the floor </p>
<p>Just how many summons could that man control?!. </p>
<p>'This . this is the true ability of Hunter Seong Jin-Woo '. </p>
<p>He couldn't close shut his slack jaw at all </p>
<p>Could the Association President Goh Gun-Hui have recognised the skill set of Hunter Seong Jin-Woo already? If so, then his sky-high interest in Hunter Seong Jin-Woo made plenty of sense </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In couldn't rip her eyes away from Jin-Woo for a long time, but she belatedly did manage that and asked Woo Jin-Cheol </p>
<p>"By the way, why are you here, Chief Woo? Was the call made to the Monitoring Division already?". </p>
<p>When Cha Hae-In asked him that question, Woo Jin-Cheol somehow managed to regain control over his emotions and replied </p>
<p>"No, that's not it . We were in the neighbourhood, just passing by . But, it was a coincidence that we discovered the Gate's abnormal condition, and we came here to help facilitate the evacuation of the raid team, but well ". </p>
<p>Woo Jin-Cheol stopped talking there and stared at Jin-Woo again </p>
<p>"However, looks like that won't be necessary . ". </p>
<p>This would be his first time witnessing Hunter Seong Jin-Woo's true skill . And that just so happened to be the spectacle of him clearing a rank A dungeon with his own power </p>
<p>It didn't look like other's help was necessary </p>
<p>"Yes . I think standing still is the right call to make here . ". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In too agreed with that assessment </p>
<p>That man's battle didn't leave any gaps for a rank S like her to butt in at all </p>
<p>"Do you know who that man is?". </p>
<p>Cha Hae-In asked </p>
<p>Woo Jin-Cheol was clearly admiring Seong Jin-Woo's skills, and obviously not worried about his identity, at least not outwardly . Also, he was an agent of the Association which did block Jin-Woo's information from leaking out, too </p>
<p>'So maybe, Woo Jin-Cheol might know who that man is . '. </p>
<p>Her expectation was on the money </p>
<p>"Yes, a little bit . ". </p>
<p>"That man . just who is he?". </p>
<p>Woo Jin-Cheol put his sunglasses back on and replied </p>
<p>"I can't reveal that information . ". </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>The Shaman was furious </p>
<p>When it first opened its eyes in this place, only one order was filling up its mind </p>
<p>- Hunt down humans!. </p>
<p>However, what was the meaning of this pathetic display?. </p>
<p>Wasn't a lone human easily hunting down every single member of its tribe? This wasn't supposed to happen . No, such a thing must not happen at all </p>
<p>The Shaman's eyes reddened even further as it witnessed the massacre of its subordinates </p>
<p>'You insect-like b*stard! I'll step on you!!'. </p>
<p>If hexes didn't work against the enemy, then all it had to do was to bless itself and fight!. </p>
<p>"The song of rage! The song of strengthening! The song of the giants! The song of the fire dragon!". </p>
<p>With the completion of the various spells, the Shaman's body suddenly ballooned up to nearly ten metres tall . Its strength, agility, stamina, and even its confidence increased greatly as well, power filling up every square inch of its frame </p>
<p>Right away, the Shaman used its gigantic arm to swat away the Shadow Soldiers, and then took a deep breath </p>
<p>And then </p>
<p>"Fuuuu-hoook!!". </p>
<p>When the Shaman spat out its breath, reddish black flames erupted out of its mouth </p>
<p>Rumble!!. </p>
<p>The soldiers immediately dissipated and scattered away when they were struck dead-on by the flames . Even those grazed by it were no exception . Parts of their bodies were blown away and they were rendered unable to carry on fighting </p>
<p>The flames didn't end with one attack; the second wave of flames spat out of the Shaman's mouth in a row </p>
<p>The Shaman was able to greatly reduce the number of the Shadow Soldiers with its continuous attacks . Having received a boost to its confidence, it roared out at the top of its lungs </p>
<p>"Do you still find this great Karugalgan funny now?!". </p>
<p>The reply came from above its head </p>
<p>"Yup . ". </p>
<p>The Shaman flinched and raised its head, all the while hurriedly trying to chant a defensive spell, but </p>
<p>But, Jin-Woo was one step quicker </p>
<p>POW!!. </p>
<p>CRACK!!. </p>
<p>The Shaman's head smashed down into the ground . The floor shattered and spiderweb-like cracks rapidly spread out </p>
<p>Jin-Woo had already experienced blowing away Vulcan with his bare fist . And that demon was much, much larger than this arrogant Shaman, too </p>
<p>[You have killed the owner of the dungeon . ]. </p>
<p>Tab </p>
<p>When he lightly landed on the ground, feel-good messages began popping up in his view one after the other </p>
<p>Tt-ring </p>
<p>[Level up!]. </p>
<p>"There you go!". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo pumped his fist </p>
<p>Back when he was fighting using 'Stealth', he levelled up once . When he was killing these Orcs, another level up . And, after killing the boss just now, another level up . Clearing this rank A dungeon netted him three level ups, in other words . This was a result well above his expectation . He even felt very grateful towards Foreman Bae for suggesting yesterday that they should work together again </p>
<p>'This is very good . '. </p>
<p>With an elated mind, Jin-Woo walked closer to the boss . The once-buffed up Shaman's body had reverted back to its original size already </p>
<p>He saw an egg-sized magic crystal embedded in the dead boss's necklace, but he decided to not to get too greedy </p>
<p>'Earning experience points is good enough . '. </p>
<p>This was the Hunters Guild's dungeon, at the end of the day </p>
<p>If he wanted to get his hands on a magic crystal from a rank A dungeon, he didn't need to enter someone else's dungeon – he'd just buy himself a permit for a dungeon of his own, instead </p>
<p>No, what Jin-Woo was aiming for was something else . And that would be the black smoke beginning to rise up from the boss's corpse </p>
<p>Gulp </p>
<p>Jin-Woo licked his lips in anticipation </p>
<p>He couldn't help but remember the corpse of Baruka, the one that slipped through his fingers back in the Red Gate </p>
<p>'But, my situation is a lot different compared to then . '. </p>
<p>Compared to now, his Stats weren't that high back then </p>
<p>Also, killing that b*stard took a lot out of him . Only after receiving the aid of two knight-grade soldiers, Igrit and Iron, did he manage to beat that boss down </p>
<p>However, he was able to kill this Shaman comparatively easily today </p>
<p>A week spent inside the Demon's Castle – this was the definite proof that the events of those short seven days weren't in vain </p>
<p>Jin-Woo issued a new order at the rising, wavering black steam-like smoke </p>
<p>"Rise up . ". </p>
<p>At the same time, an ominous wind brushed past his two cheeks . He instinctively realised it right away </p>
<p>'It worked!'. </p>
<p>A radiant smile bloomed on Jin-Woo's face </p>
<p>Kuwaaaahhh!!. </p>
<p>As the soul-tearing scream resounded out, a mage covered in black robe rose up from the shadow of the dead Shaman </p>
<p>' . Huh?'. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo sensed something was different about this guy, and so he checked the information window </p>
<p>[?? Lv . 1]. </p>
<p>Elite Knight grade. </p>
<p>'An Elite Knight?'. </p>
<p>Previously, Jin-Woo was able to confirm that there were three grades to the Shadow Soldiers </p>
<p>Regular grade </p>
<p>Elite grade </p>
<p>And then, the Knight grade </p>
<p>But now, for the first time ever, the 'Elite Knight' grade appeared </p>
<p>He began to think that, seeing the word 'elite' tacked on to the already-existing grade 'Knight', this new guy had to be a realm higher than either Igrit or Iron in terms of combat prowess </p>
<p>'For sure, I can sense that its magic energy is far greater than that of my two knights . '. </p>
<p>As expected of turning the boss of a rank A dungeon into his Shadow Soldier </p>
<p>Tti-ring </p>
<p>[Please set the soldier's name . ]. </p>
<p>And also as expected, he got another System message telling to name the new guy, now that another Knight-grade Shadow Soldier had appeared </p>
<p>'A name, is it '. </p>
<p>Well, its face was hidden under the hood of the robe now, but still, High Orcs and lengthy fangs went hand in hand, no?. </p>
<p>'Right, let's name it Fangs . ' (TL note at the end). </p>
<p>He didn't need to issue a separate order; just thinking about it meant the new guy's name would be set </p>
<p>[Fangs Lv . 1]. </p>
<p>Elite Knight grade </p>
<p>Instead of question marks, the new name appeared in the information window </p>
<p>If the Shaman who remained utterly arrogant right till the moment it died heard this name, the poor guy might have fainted on the spot . But well, who cares? It was already dead, anyway </p>
<p>With a satisfied grin on his face, Jin-Woo recalled his Shadow Soldiers </p>
<p>He could now store almost 130 of them . Although it was a bit regrettable, he had to return the rest back to the void </p>
<p>'This much is more than enough, though . '. </p>
<p>He stepped off from the altar with a big smile on his face, but then, several people rushed over to him . They were – Hunters from the raid team, Cha Hae-In, and finally, a group of men wearing matching black business suits </p>
<p>Jin-Woo recognised one of the faces among the black suits </p>
<p>'Since when did Chief Woo Jin-Cheol show up?'. </p>
<p>Seeing the expression on Woo Jin-Cheol, he probably had witnessed the Shadow Soldiers in action in full </p>
<p>"Mister Seong Jin-Woo . ". </p>
<p>"Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>"Mister Porter?!". </p>
<p>Everyone called out to him at the same time, then they took glances at each other </p>
<p>Well, it was all fine and dandy that he got to fight to his heart's content since he no longer had any reason to hide his powers, but </p>
<p>'… . How am I supposed to get out of this now?'. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo looked at all these people surrounding him and scratched the back of his head </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 91 &gt; Fin </p>
<p>(TL: Right, for some reason, this author keep using the Korean word for molars when describing the characteristics of the High Orc . So, he named the new Shadow Soldier "Molar" but I just couldn't use that in my good conscience and swapped it out to "Fangs" which, to me personally, make more physiological sense . I mean, lengthy molars wouldn't be practical at all, right? And I'm pretty sure Orcs have long fangs, not long molars ). </p>
