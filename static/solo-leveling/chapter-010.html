<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 10</p>
<p>Panicking, Jinwoo tried to get a grasp of the situation; suddenly, he heard the sound of sand shifting . </p>
<p>ssssssss</p>
<p>The sand on the ground next to him was sinking into the ground . </p>
<p>“Uh, uh oh!”</p>
<p>Using all his strength, Jinwoo struggled to not be sucked into the whirlpool .  As the sunken area became wider, Jinwoo barely escaped the sinkhole using his two hands . </p>
<p>“Pant, pant, pant”</p>
<p>As he sat panting, he looked down into the newly created depression on the ground .  The sand at the lowest point of the hole was boiling strangely . Jinwoo shuddered as he realized a single misstep would’ve resulted in him falling down into that hole . </p>
<p>“Wait…”</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed . </p>
<p>“It’s not boiling . ”</p>
<p>Taking a closer look, he realized something big was wriggling beneath the sand at the bottom of the depression .  Jinwoo stood up instinctively . Something did not feel right . </p>
<p>Confirming his suspicions, a pillar of sand shot up from the hole as he was walking backwards . </p>
<p>Shaaaah!</p>
<p>Sounding like a waterfall, the sand fell all around him, revealing what had appeared from the hole .  Jinwoo’s eyes widened . </p>
<p>“A-a bug?”</p>
<p>A giant centipede had risen out of the sand . </p>
<p>Screeeech!</p>
<p>The fully revealed form of the monster stood taller than a 5-story building . </p>
<p>Jinwoo gulped . </p>
<p>‘This is impossible…’</p>
<p>And like so, it was an impossibly large existence .  He had never heard of a centipede of this size before .  But it wasn’t just the size of the centipede that shocked Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Why… why is there a name floating above that thing’s head?”</p>
<p>Was he dreaming?</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and opened them again .  Nothing had changed . The centipede’s name floated above its head in red letters .  Like a video game monster . </p>
<p>‘Poison-fanged Giant Sand Centipede[1]’</p>
<p>Alongside its uncanny and dangerous looking figure, it had a name that screamed at him to run .  Especially the “poison-fanged” part . Two fangs the size of a child caught Jinwoo’s eye . It was very clear from its name what would happen if he was pierced by them . </p>
<p>Jinwoo saw the centipede’s mouth open and close repeatedly without rest . </p>
<p>“Looks like it’s hungry . ”</p>
<p>At that time, a sound rang through his head . </p>
<p>ring~</p>

<p>‘You’re kidding, right…?’</p>
<p>But the second the remaining time decreased to 3 Hours 59 Min 59 Sec, the centipede started moving across the sand as if it was waiting . </p>
<p>sliiiiiide</p>
<p>“Wait, what?!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo quickly turned and started running . </p>
<p>Tripping, he fell and rolled on the ground and quickly shook the sand off his head .  His eyes widened looking at the sight before him . There were more pillars of sand appearing in front of him . </p>
<p>shaaaah</p>
<p>shaaaaaaah</p>
<p>Before he realized it, seven centipede heads had risen from the ground and were staring down at him . </p>
<p>Screech!</p>
<p>Screeeeech!</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s face paled as he heard their terrifying shrieks . </p>
<p>“Shit…”</p>
<p>Exactly 4 hours later, he reappeared in the hospital room . </p>
<p>collapse-</p>
<p>Lying on the floor of his room, he coughed in agony . </p>
<p>*cough* *cough* *spit* *spit*</p>
<p>The inside of his mouth was dry .  His eyes stung from the sand . Jinwoo sprawled out on the ground, moaning .  He did not have the strength to even move a finger . </p>
<p>“Hah… hah… what… was… that…?”</p>
<p>A new message appeared before the panting Jinwoo . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve completed the “Penalty Quest” . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>His brows furrowed . </p>
<p>Penalty Quest?</p>
<p>Did he do something to deserve punishment?</p>
<p>Searching his memories, he remembered the [Daily Quest] that he half-heartedly gave up on . </p>
<p>‘It can’t be…’</p>
<p>He recalled the part of the quest that talked about receiving a penalty if he did not complete it . </p>
<p>“Hah… hah… you mean… that wasn’t . a hallucination . ?”</p>
<p>Indeed . </p>
<p>It was not a hallucination . </p>
<p>Nor a dream . </p>
<p>There was no need to check by pinching his cheeks .  The pain of running until his breath ran out; the pain of being scratched by the centipede’s legs; he felt them all even right now . </p>
<p>It was all real .  He had almost met his death back there . </p>
<p>“This… is… too… much… hah… hah…”</p>
<p>To think that something like a penalty would throw him into the jaws of death .  At the same time, a foreboding dread washed over him . If what just happened now was due to the daily quest, it meant that all of this was not over yet . </p>
<p>As if on cue, the electronic sound rang . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>Startled at first, he relaxed as he realized it was not another quest . </p>
<p>.  . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The reward for completing the Penalty Quest has arrived . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to verify? (Y/N)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Reward…?’</p>
<p>The word “reward” briefly caught his attention .  Unfortunately, Jinwoo lacked the strength to care about anything at the moment .  It was a testament to how tough the Penalty Quest had been . </p>
<p>‘Reward or whatever… I just want to rest for now…’</p>
<p>And with that, he fell into a deep slumber . </p>
<p>“Oh no! Why is he on the ground?!”</p>
<p>Next morning, his assigned nurse was greeted with a shocking scene when she entered the room .  The patient was lying on the floor, and there was sand scattered about the ground . Even the patient’s clothes were filled with sand .  The nurse threw the treatment chart onto the bed and pressed the call button . </p>
<p>“Someone come help!”</p>
<p>Soon, Dr . Joo Chiui arrived . </p>
<p>“What’s the ma- why is Mr . Sung on the ground?!”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure! He was fine until last night! I found him like this just now . ”</p>
<p>“Let’s first get him on to the bed .  One . Two!”</p>
<p>The two put Jinwoo onto the bed .  In the rough movement, the medical chart that was thrown on the bed made a small papercut on the back of Jinwoo’s hand, but no one noticed . </p>
<p>“Now, let’s check him . ”</p>
<p>Joo Chiui went over Jinwoo’s condition, but found no abnormalities . </p>
<p>“What’s this? He’s just sleeping . ”</p>
<p>He sighed in relief .  The Hunter Association had requested special care for this patient .  He had been nervous in fear that something had happened to him . </p>
<p>“Let’s just let him rest .  He seems to be in deep sleep . ”</p>
<p>After he spoke, Joo Chiui began to leave when he noticed the sand in the room . </p>
<p>“Er… Looks like we should clean-up this room a little .  Ms . Yura, I’ll leave it to you . ”</p>
<p>“Understood, doctor . ”</p>
<p>As the doctor left the room, nurse Choi Yura also relaxed in relief .  It was a good thing nothing bad had happened . After all, there were no doctors or nurses who wished ill upon their patients .  The hospital she worked at was specially dedicated to the treatment of Hunters . Having seen the unfortunate end of many Hunters before, she did not want to see yet another Hunter be hurt under her care . </p>
<p>“Phew-”</p>
<p>Calmed down, she began to figure out how to clean the room when she noticed something on the ground .  It was a drop of blood . </p>
<p>“Oh my . ”</p>
<p>The drop of blood had fallen from the patient’s hand that stretched out from the bed over the ground .  Surprised, she looked for a wound on Jinwoo’s hand and held it in inspection . Turning over to the back of his hand,</p>
<p>“ . This is…?”</p>
<p>She saw traces of fresh blood, but no scar .  Wiping away the blood, the hand was completely clean . </p>
<p>‘Did… did his cut heal in an instant?’</p>
<p>With concern, Yura looked over to Jinwoo’s face . </p>
<p>He appeared to be sleeping without a care in the world . </p>
<p></p>
<p>-7 . Daily Quest-</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>[The Daily Quest has arrived . ]</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes shot open .  Sitting straight up from the bed, the first thing Jinwoo did was to check the time; it was a little past 4:30 in the afternoon .  There was roughly 7 hours and 30 minutes of breathing room until midnight . </p>
<p>‘Good . ’</p>
<p>He opened the message box . </p>

<p>“Same thing?” He uttered reflexively .  No, perhaps this was a good thing . Compared to a possibly difficult quest, this was much better .  Even if it strained his body, it was at least something that could be completed with time . </p>
<p>He went on the floor and began the push-ups . </p>
<p>“One . ”</p>
<p>He couldn’t afford to be dragged to some strange place and be forced to run from death again . </p>

<p>As if testing the System, he performed a half-hearted push-up, going only part way down, but it did not register on the screen .  He understood why his weak attempts last night did nothing . </p>

<p>Although exasperated, he did not let-up the strength in his arms .  50 push-ups remaining . After that would be sit-ups . </p>
