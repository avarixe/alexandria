<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 52</p>
<p>What the hell was this . </p>
<p>How did it start off so nicely towards ‘Assassin’, then veer sharply to ‘Necromancer’?</p>
<p>Jinwoo blankly stared at the results with a dumbfounded expression . </p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes, but the words did not change . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Your class is the Necromancer . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The message still floated in front of him .  His initial disbelief was followed by anger . </p>
<p>‘I never even touched the intelligence stat! Why?!’</p>
<p>Of all the Mage-class Hunters, he had never heard of a Necromancer .  When he first Awakened as an E-ranker, Jinwoo was a Fighter-class . Putting aside the sword he briefly used in the beginning, he had solely used a dagger up until now, and the skills he obtained easily belonged to the Assassin-class .  He could not have imagined that an entirely different category of class would appear . </p>
<p>To think that he would receive a Mage-class, not only that, the Necromancer . </p>
<p>He only knew of the class through video game knowledge, but he had a rough idea of what the Necromancer class entailed .  A distasteful mage followed by an undead army . No matter how he thought about it, it did not fit him . Jinwoo relaxed his scrunched face and shook his head . </p>
<p>‘ . For now, let’s calm down . ’</p>
<p>Even if his thoughts were in chaos, he would approach the situation calmly .  This calmness was one of Jinwoo’s weapons . Taking a moment, he was able to find his composure . </p>
<p>‘Still, how the hell…’</p>
<p>Denial, then anger .  He felt like a patient that had received a terminal diagnosis, going through the five stages of grief . </p>
<p>‘Anger Then was it bargaining or compromise?’</p>
<p>In this situation, there was not much room to compromise .  If he had to pick the benefits of the Necromancer class… as the System said, he supposed he could make his own army . </p>
<p>‘The problem is that the army would be composed of soldiers made of bones and corpses . ’</p>
<p>Taking that around the real world would flip society on its back .  Hunters were already the target of envy and fear . Imagine if a Hunter led an ‘Army of the Dead’ around .  Forget compatibility, he could not imagine shouldering the burden . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to accept the class?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The System asked for his reply . </p>
<p>Oh thank god . </p>
<p>‘I have a choice…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo sighed in relief .  The fact that the class wasn’t being forced on him meant that he had another chance .  And if he had another chance, he was not about to hesitate . </p>
<p>Jinwoo easily(?) refused the offer . </p>
<p>“Nope . ”</p>
<p>Then the message asked again . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Necromancer is a “Hidden Class” . Would you still like to refuse?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>It was basically the same question, but he could not readily reply after being asked twice .  This time, he hesitated . </p>
<p>‘Hidden… Class?’</p>
<p>It was certainly something that could be found in a game, but in reality, there were Hunters with rare abilities .  A Hunter that could form barriers, or a Hunter that could cast buffs . </p>
<p>‘I heard a rumor that Baekho’s Guildmaster Baek Yoonho even has the ability to transform into a magic beast . ’</p>
<p>All those Hunters with special powers worked for large Guilds and wielded an immense amount of influence and power . </p>
<p>‘When it says a “Hidden Class”, is it talking about those Hunters with special powers?’</p>
<p>If that was the case…</p>
<p>‘This might be a good chance . ’</p>
<p>He imagined the System talking to him . </p>
<p>“I’m offering you the Necromancer class because I know you want a great power . ”</p>
<p>In that sense, the Necromancer was probably a powerful class .  In fact, he remembered that most of the Hunters with special powers fell under the Support-class .  On the contrary, he would be a Hunter with a special power under the Combat-class . Little by little, his heart began to race . </p>
<p>‘If I could only try out the Necromancer-class, I wouldn’t be hesitating this much . ’</p>
<p>But it was a hopeless thought .  Things wouldn’t just go like that his way, and he had never heard of anyone with such powers .  In fact, he had never heard of summoners who fought and commanded an army . When he reached that line of thought,</p>
<p>‘Wait…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around the fallen army of knights around him . </p>
<p>‘Those mages!’</p>
<p>In a way, the mages that he fought during the class advancement quest wielded similar powers as a Necromancer .  The knights were their army . </p>
<p>‘Hmm…’</p>
<p>Fighting the knights that threw themselves at Jinwoo without a care for their lives was annoying .  If he failed to solve the answer to the fight, or if the combat prowess of the mages were not low…</p>
<p>‘What would be lying on the ground aren’t these pieces of metal but me . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo raised his head .  An understanding filled his eyes . </p>
<p>‘My combat prowess is not low . ’</p>
<p>He was different than these mages .  What would happen if the summoner that led an army also maintained a great individual might? It would truly be a nightmare to his enemies . </p>
<p>‘If it could be like that…’</p>
<p>The fleeting idea that was like a dream to him in the past .  It might even be possible for him to solo clear a B-rank Dungeon and above .  Jinwoo gulped . If he could continue to raise his abilities after becoming a Necromancer, naturally, the army under him would also become stronger .  The synergy of growth surpassed his imagination . </p>
<p>‘It’s not just solo leveling . ’</p>
<p>His army would level with him . </p>
<p>‘Is it possible ?’</p>
<p>A chill ran down his back .  Jinwoo looked up at the floating message .  It quietly waited for his reply . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Necromancer is a “Hidden Class” . Would you still like to refuse?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Contrary to before, it did not press the question .  Jinwoo asked within his thoughts,</p>
<p>‘Is this what you wanted for me?’</p>
<p>Of course, the System did not reply . </p>
<p>After much thought, Jinwoo made a decision . </p>
<p>If it was giving him a strong power, he would accept . </p>
<p>He no longer hesitated . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to accept the class?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Alright . ”</p>
<p>As if waiting, the System immediately sent the next message . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve accepted your class . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Depending on the advancement points earned, you may advance to a higher class . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The points will be calculated now . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Calculating . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>While the System calculated, Jinwoo unwrapped the wrapping around his right hand .  He had clenched the grip so hard that welts appeared on the palm . </p>
<p>“This is going to blister . ”</p>
<p>He lightly clicked his tongue .  It could be taken care of with single drop of a healing potion, but the fact that he wasn’t able to do so in this place was inconvenient .  As he returned Knight Killer into the inventory, the System rang . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>Jinwoo raised his head in response . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve surpassed the expected time limit!</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Extra points are awarded . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Extra points .  Well, it made sense . </p>
<p>‘Not sure what the expected time limit was, but I did last for quite a long time . </p>
<p>He chuckled in satisfaction, but then suddenly, numerous messages appeared before his eyes . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You did not use the Instant Return Stone!</strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>ring~ ring~ ring~</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>The repeating tone was piercing to the ears, but the sound didn’t even register in Jinwoo’s mind .  His gaze was affixed on two specific words . </p>
<p>‘Special reward?’</p>
<p>Reward .  A “Special” one . </p>
<p>Jinwoo’s hands that were placing Knight Killer into the inventory froze, and his eyes stared at the message box .  He could not look away . The message continued . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You have advanced from Necromancer to Monarch of Shadows . [1]</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve learned class-specific skills . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Monarch of Shadows?’</p>
<p>At an unfamiliar name, he quickly opened his status screen . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Name: Sung Jinwoo</strong>. </p>
<p>Level: 51</p>
<p>Class: Monarch of Shadows</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>His new class was placed at the appropriate spot . </p>
<p>‘It’s not Necromancer?’</p>
<p>The System did tell him that depending on the advancement points, it was possible to advance to a higher class .  And just now, it told him that his advancement points surpassed the required amount . And the resulting class was the “Monarch of Shadows” . </p>
<p>“So this is the…”</p>
<p>Special reward that the System spoke of?</p>
<p>He could not put into words what he witnessed next . </p>
<p>‘ . ?’</p>
<p>Something strange was happening before his eyes, behind the floating message .  There was a strange black smoke rising from the corpses of the knights that littered the view in front of him .  It was not there before the class advancement . Just a moment ago, they were mere pieces of metal without a controller . </p>
<p>And now…</p>
<p>Jinwoo closed his status screen and looked around .  It was not just one or two of them . Every single fallen knights were giving off the black smoke . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>It’s a possible target for Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>It’s a possible target for Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>It’s a possible target for Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Every time he looked at a corpse with the black smoke, a message appeared, telling him that extraction was possible . </p>
<p>‘Shadow Extraction?’</p>
<p>He had no idea what this meant .  The black smoke almost looked like it was twisting in pain .  It felt like they were stretching a hand towards him, asking him to rescue them .  Would it be weird to say that he could . hear screaming?</p>
<p>‘But . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was sure .  He would be able to save them from their pain . </p>
<p>‘Shadow Extraction . ’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Please choose the command phrase for Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘I have to assign a spoken phrase to the skill?’</p>
<p>After a brief moment, Jinwoo spoke out of instinct . </p>
<p>“Arise . ”</p>
<p>And with that-</p>
<p>Uwaaaaaah-</p>
<p>With a heavy moan that came from somewhere, the shadows of the knights started quivering as if it was alive .  Jinwoo looked around the fallen army . All of their shadows were moving . A black hand appeared from one of the shadows .  Then it placed itself on the ground and seemingly pulled itself up from the shadows . </p>
<p>‘Holy shit!’</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes were wide open . </p>
<p>It was human . </p>
<p>More accurately, soldiers in the shape of man!</p>
<p>Covered from head to toe in pitch black armor, soldiers started appearing one by one from the shadows . </p>
<p>‘This is a skill?’</p>
<p>Before he realized it, several dozen soldiers had risen . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve succeeded in Shadow Extraction . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The dozen of soldiers stood, surrounding him . </p>
<p>‘What is this…’</p>
<p>He approached the closest soldier . </p>
<p>. <strong>First, touch . </strong>. </p>
<p>He placed a hand on them and felt metal .  The armor wasn’t just for show . They really were soldiers clad in pitch black armor, holding weapons . </p>
<p>‘They look like a person . ’</p>
<p>But they were not human . </p>
<p>He did not sense any lifeforce coming from them .  Not a sound of breathing or a hint of a heartbeat . </p>
<p>On top of that . </p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo swallowed a scream .  He had taken a look through the visors of the helmet .  Inside was darkness itself . Feeling as if he would be swallowed by it, Jinwoo slowly took few steps backwards . </p>
<p>‘All of them were spawned from the shadows?’</p>
<p>He quickly opened up his skill screen .  As the System had told him, there were new class-specific skills in his listing . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Class-specific Skills</strong>.   </p>
<p>Active Skills</p>
<p>-Shadow Extraction (Lv . 1)</p>
<p>-Shadow Storage (Lv . 1)</p>

<p>He checked the first skill . </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>After reading the skill’s explanation, he was able to ascertain the identity of the black soldiers . </p>
<p>‘ . They’re the undead . ’</p>
<p>Shadow Soldier . </p>
<p>It was a monster created from a corpse’s shadow . </p>
<p>Jinwoo gulped . </p>
<p>‘If these guys are really my soldiers…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo stretched his hand to the right .  The soldiers all turned right . He slowly moved the hand to himself .  The soldiers followed his hand and faced forward . In the middle of their gazes stood Jinwoo .  He calmed his beating heart and lowered his hand . </p>
<p>Clack</p>
<p>Clack . </p>
<p>All the soldiers kneeled before him .  It was all moving according to his will . </p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo expressed his amazement, and the corners of his mouth rose . </p>
<p>‘This is so cool . ’</p>
