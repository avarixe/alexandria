<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 83</p>
<p>Jinwoo felt his heart sinking to his stomach . </p>
<p>‘When did she come?’</p>
<p>Because he had been too focused on the boss, he had not realized someone else had arrived . </p>
<p>‘I’ve been found out . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo clicked his tongue with disappointment . </p>
<p>tsk</p>
<p>Now that a witness was here, he snapped out of his greed towards the boss .  Hunters Guild had bought the raiding rights of this Gate; in a sense, the boss was the property of Hunters Guild .  On top of that, if he took down the boss right now, the Gate would close and the unfinished jobs of the collection and mining teams would result in a great loss for the Guild . </p>
<p>‘I almost did something terrible . ’</p>
<p>Blinded by the greed of leveling up, he almost laid hands on someone else’s property .  Jinwoo came to his senses and breathed a sigh of relief . Meanwhile, the owner of the voice came closer,</p>
<p>“Excuse me, I asked you a question . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo smiled awkwardly and turned around,</p>
<p>“Er, I got lost and ended up here . ”</p>
<p>“You got lost?”</p>
<p>The voice was flustered .  Jinwoo realized who the owner of the voice was . </p>
<p>‘Huh? This woman is…?’</p>
<p>That face he saw before entering the Dungeon .  It was the female S-rank Hunter, Cha Haein . She slowly closed the gap toward Jinwoo and looked at the man’s hands . </p>
<p>‘I swear I saw him holding weapons . ’</p>
<p>Was she mistaken? Whatever he was holding had disappeared as if it was never there .  The woman looked up and down on Jinwoo . </p>
<p>‘Hard hat and work clothes… Is he a Hunter from our mining team?’</p>
<p>It seemed that the man’s excuse that he was lost was not a lie .  Still, regardless of his reason, the boss room was a dangerous place .  Cha Haein decided that sending him away from here was more important than finding out the truth . </p>
<p>“This is a place where the boss resides . ”</p>
<p>As she always would, Cha Haein pinched her nose with a handkerchief and stood before Jinwoo . </p>
<p>“Please get away from here . If you accidently grab aggro, everyone here could end up dying . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m sorry . ”</p>
<p>Thankfully, it looked like his acting worked .  Jinwoo walked past Cha Haein with a satisfied face . </p>
<p>As he passed by,</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>Cha Haein turned her head toward Jinwoo .  Something impossible happened . With her eyes wide open, the S-rank Hunter stopped Jinwoo before she realized it,</p>
<p>“Hey, excuse me . ”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Hold on a minute . ”</p>
<p>What is this woman doing? Like a thief who had been caught, Jinwoo did not particularly feel good as Cha Haein approached him .  The woman got uncomfortably close to him . </p>
<p>“Er… what is it?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo asked with an awkward face .  However, Cha Haein did not reply . Instead, the woman boldly sniffed the man .  She had already put her handkerchief away . </p>
<p>‘What the hell?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo had no idea what was happening . </p>
<p>‘Why is she smelling me?’</p>
<p>The man was flustered .  However, the woman was even more so . </p>
<p>‘There’s no . foul stench . ’</p>
<p>This was the first time she had met a Hunter without that foul smell .  Cha Haein looked at Jinwoo with wide open eyes . A question mark appeared on Jinwoo’s face . </p>
<p>“Is there something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Are you… really a Hunter?”</p>
<p>Was there a need to go into detail? Jinwoo removed the Hunter’s license around his neck and held it out to her .  The woman took the license and looked back and forth between Jinwoo’s face and the picture on the license . </p>
<p>‘E-rank… Sung Jinwoo…’</p>
<p>Was it because his rank was too low? There was no bad smell coming from Jinwoo .  In fact, she smelled a pleasant fragrance from him . </p>
<p>Jinwoo carefully took his license from Cha Haein’s hands . </p>
<p>“So… Can I go?”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>The woman realized she no longer had any reason to hold him here . </p>
<p>“ . Never mind . Please be careful on your way back . The Dungeon is large . ”</p>
<p>“Ah, okay . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo bid his goodbye then walked back towards the direction of the work area .  His back quickly disappeared in the distance of the cave . However, Cha Haein stood still looking at the direction the man walked off to for some time . </p>
<p>‘He smelled nice…’</p>
<p>After finishing lunch, the Hunters of the mining team returned to the work area .  Walking in while picking his teeth, Team Leader Bae jumped after discovering Jinwoo coming back from deep into the Dungeon . </p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa . Sung-ssi, why are you coming from that way?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo briefly turned his head back to the boss room’s direction . </p>
<p>‘I can’t exactly explain that I was curious about what the A-rank Dungeon’s boss looked like, right?’</p>
<p>He turned back to the team leader . </p>
<p>“I got lost while looking for the bathroom . ”</p>
<p>“Oh, no! You have to be careful! Lots of Dungeons are like mazes . If you get lost, you might never find your way back . In fact, how did you find your way back?”</p>
<p>“I ran into Hunter Cha Haein-nim on the way back…”</p>
<p>“Ah, Hunter Cha-nim? She went to keep watch just in case the boss came out of its room . Like you, she’s a rather worry-filled person . ”</p>
<p>Team Leader Bae laughed energetically .  It seemed like Jinwoo’s questions earlier about the boss had given the man a wrong impression .  Jinwoo smiled bitterly . </p>
<p>‘The team leader can laugh since he doesn’t know how scary the boss is . ’</p>
<p>This was the difference between the work team and the raiding party .  Knowing the true terror of magic beasts, Cha Haein was keeping watch and preparing for the worst case scenario that these men did not give a second thought to . </p>
<p>‘Even with that expressionless face, she’s got a side like that to her . ’</p>
<p>If the boss left its room, the ones in danger were not the raiding party .  It was the labor team working while the raiding party was absent . To protect their lives, the woman had forgone sweet resting time and went to keep watch at the boss room . </p>
<p>‘ . She’s an amazing woman . ’</p>
<p>This was Jinwoo’s honest opinion of Cha Haein .  Suddenly, he recalled the woman’s strange habit . </p>
<p>‘Why does she block her nose with that handkerchief?’</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, other than the time just now, she had constantly held that handkerchief to her nose . </p>
<p>“Team leader,”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Instead of being annoyed by the pestering, Team Leader Bae was rather friendly and accomodating whenever Jinwoo called to him . </p>
<p>‘He did seem to respond well to my work earlier . ’</p>
<p>It seemed that his prowess had earned some brownie points with the team leader .  Thanks to that, Jinwoo was able to comfortably ask things here and there . If anything, Team Leader Bae was the one who pressed him,</p>
<p>“Why are you quiet after calling a man over, Sung-ssi?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo grinned and replied,</p>
<p>“No it’s nothing I was just curious on why Hunter Cha Haein carried that handkerchief around . ”</p>
<p>“Oh, that? She’s a little special . ”</p>
<p>“Special?”</p>
<p>What did that mean? The team leader explained patiently,</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard, Hunter Cha is able to smell something from Hunters . It’s apparently not a good smell . ”</p>
<p>“A Hunter’s smell?”</p>
<p>“Something about a unique physiology . ”</p>
<p>A unique physiology .  Jinwoo had something similar: his keen sense of hearing .  Even before he had become an Awakened Being, the young man had good ears .  And after he Awakened? Well, even as an E-rank Hunter, his hearing was a level above others . </p>
<p>‘Her sense of smell must’ve also been enhanced after Awakening . ’</p>
<p>He understood her to a degree . </p>
<p>“Peculiar, right?”</p>
<p>As if liking that Jinwoo was paying attention, Team Leader Bae continued,</p>
<p>“I heard that because of that smell, she has difficulty breathing around Hunters . ”</p>
<p>“ . ”</p>
<p>Was that the reason?</p>
<p>‘Why she asked me if I was really a Hunter . ’</p>
<p>Was it because he did not smell like a Hunter? Jinwoo recalled the words of the leader of the White Walkers back in the Red Gate,</p>
<p>[“In our head, there is a voice whispering to us without rest . It tells us to ‘kill all humans’ . But in front of you, the voice becomes silent . ”]</p>
<p>Was it related to what that thing told him?</p>
<p>Not having the smell associated with Hunters, not being told to be killed like humans . </p>
<p>‘Because I am a Player…’</p>
<p>The absolute singular existence that was chosen by the System . </p>
<p>Just what was a Player?</p>
<p>Briefly questioning his own identity, Jinwoo quickly shook his head,</p>
<p>‘Not like I can obtain the answer to that question right now . ’</p>
<p>He cleared his mind .  Worrying about a riddle that he could not solve would only exhaust him mentally . </p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Soon, the sound of his coworkers mining started .  Jinwoo also grabbed his pickaxe . </p>
<p>‘An A-rank Boss… I really wanted to kill it . ’</p>
<p>What would’ve happened if Cha Haein didn’t arrive on time?</p>
<p>Jinwoo swung away while thinking about it . </p>
<p>Because of Jinwoo’s outstanding performance, the mining team managed to finish their work before dinner .  According to the team leader, it was two hours earlier than usual . Because of that, the eyes of his teammates looking at him had changed . </p>
<p>“Good work today, Sung-ssi!”</p>
<p>“Not bad!”</p>
<p>“I thought someone brought in a mining machine, haha!”</p>
<p>The Hunters surrounded him and poured compliments all over him .  The cold attitude they greeted him with before the Gate had all but disappeared .  Jinwoo was also in a good mood . The experience of working as a miner was interesting, and he had succeeded in his objective of scouting an A-rank Dungeon . </p>
<p>“Let’s go!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“Let’s go go go!”</p>
<p>At Team Leader Bae’s order, the mining team moved as one towards the exit . </p>
<p>“One! Two!”</p>
<p>“Pull!”</p>
<p>They passed by the still working collection team .  Soon, the mining team left the Dungeon and loitered while preparing to leave .  Compared to the Guild’s official members, the temp worker Sung Jinwoo’s pay was provided on the spot . </p>
<p>“Sung-ssi, here you go, this is yours . ”</p>
<p>“Thank you . ”</p>
<p>While handing over the envelope, Team Leader Bae discretely asked him a question,</p>
<p>“We’re about to go for some food, would you like to join us?”</p>
<p>While the question was asked casually, the team leader’s eyes were serious . </p>
<p>‘It feels like he has something he wants to ask me…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo felt the man’s sincerity .  However, he politely declined . </p>
<p>“I’m sorry . ”</p>
<p>“Hmm… That’s okay . ”</p>
<p>The team leader scratched his chin . </p>
<p>‘I wanted to ask him while we were in a good mood with alcohol…’</p>
<p>But the man had to change his plans a bit,</p>
<p>“You know, I’ve met a lot of people while working on this job . ”</p>
<p>“Mhmm . ”</p>
<p>“But I’ve never seen a man like you . You were born to be a miner . ”</p>
<p>It seemed that the team leader had taken a liking to him . </p>
<p>‘Haha… That’s a bit…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo could neither confirm nor deny the team leader’s words .  Instead, he awkwardly laughed . Confusing that for a good sign, the team leader got to business,</p>
<p>“I don’t normally do this but… How would you like to come work under me? I guarantee you’ll be paid well . ”</p>
<p>The young man called Sung Jinwoo .  On his first day as a miner, the man had completed several times more work than a veteran miner .  If he could not obtain this genius, it would be his failure as the leader of the mining team . Even if he had to talk to the higher-ups to provide a special consideration for Jinwoo, the team leader wanted to hire the young man . </p>
<p>However, Jinwoo’s refusal was firm . </p>
<p>“I’m grateful for your words but… There’s something I’m preparing for . ”</p>
<p>At that sentence, the team leader’s cheerful mood fell . </p>
<p>“Is… is that so?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo swallowed a laughter . </p>
<p>‘What a fun person . ’</p>
<p>To think that his feelings would show this much on his face .  It seemed that Team Leader Bae thought he had discovered some hidden talent in the E-ranker .  After a moment of thought, the team leader carefully asked,</p>
<p>“How about tomorrow? Do you think you could come out again?”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow is a bit… Hmm…”</p>
<p>Well, he was still free tomorrow .  The remeasurement was two days from now .  But Jinwoo wondered if there was a reason for him to work as a miner again .  He had already observed the raiding method of a large Guild and even took a look at an A-rank Dungeon’s boss . </p>
<p>Suddenly, Jinwoo realized something,</p>
<p>‘Hold on . ’</p>
<p>He was about to refuse when a question flashed across his mind,</p>
<p>“Does that mean Hunters Guild has another Raid tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Yep . It’s another A-rank Gate . ”</p>
<p>“Is that even possible? They just finished a Raid today . ”</p>
<p>It was common practice for raiding parties to rest for a week after completing a Raid . </p>
<p>‘They said that today’s Raid started yesterday evening . ’</p>
<p>That meant the main raiding party of Hunters Guild had raided for two consecutive days .  On top of that, by the time they went back to take down the boss after the collection team finished, it would be dawn .  Jinwoo couldn’t imagine that they would raid again tomorrow . </p>
<p>When Jinwoo looked interested, the team leader continued,</p>
<p>“Instead of Attack Team A, Attack Team B will be up to the plate tomorrow . ”</p>
<p>Attack Team B? They were going to clear an A-rank Dungeon with the secondary raiding party?</p>
<p>“This is the power of Hunters Guild . We’re probably the only Guild in South Korea that can take down two A-rank Gates with two separate teams . ”</p>
<p>Team Leader Bae spoke with pride . </p>
<p>“Is this how Hunters Guild always raided?”</p>
<p>“No, no . Normally they wouldn’t divide up the teams like that . But seems like the jobs overlapped this time . ”</p>
<p>Because two A-rank Gates had simultaneously appeared in Hunters Guild’s territory, the team leader explained that Guildmaster Choi Jongin had to pull a lot of strings in order to obtain the raiding rights for both of them . </p>
<p>‘Oh, so that’s why Guildmaster Choi was at the Association yesterday…’</p>
<p>A busy man like Choi Jongin would not have frivolously visited the Association . </p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded,</p>
<p>“So does that mean this is the first time the secondary raiding party will be the sole attack team of the Raid?”</p>
<p>“Yep . But don’t let that fool you . Hunters Guild’s secondary team is not just any secondary team . They’re better than most large Guild’s primary team . ”</p>
<p>“Still, it should be much more dangerous than today, right?”</p>
<p>Team Leader Bae was at a loss for words .  Jinwoo was right . Two S-rankers had participated in the Raid today .  Compared to that, only A-rankers would be part of the offensive tomorrow .  Even though they had heard that tomorrow’s Gate was smaller than today’s, the absence of the two S-rankers would be great .  The team leader recalled how Sung-ssi was worried about the boss even though the S-rankers were nearby . </p>
<p>‘Still, I don’t want to lie to the man . ’</p>
<p>Team Leader Bae had hoped to work with Jinwoo tomorrow .  Realizing that would not happen, the man answered him disappointedly,</p>
<p>“It’ll be much more dangerous . If things go wrong, the Raid itself might fail . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo’s eyes lit up . </p>
