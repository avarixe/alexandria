<h3>Chapter 129: Chapter 129</h3> 
<p>Jin-Woo didn't particularly mind the gazes of other people, unless he was talking about some special circumstances . As long as no one bothered him, it didn't matter to him if he got famous, either </p>
<p>That's why he didn't really care when the mourners discovered his presence and started whispering among themselves </p>
<p>However . </p>
<p>'At the very least, you all should know that now isn't the time nor the place . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo furrowed his brows unhappily </p>
<p>Wasn't this the place to remember and honour the valiant sacrifice of Hunter Min Byung-Gu?. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo didn't want this solemn occasion to fall into some noisy chaos because of him, so he briefly unleashed a portion of his magic energy – no, not even that, but an amount so tiny that it didn't even qualify to be called a portion </p>
<p>'… !!'. </p>
<p>The desired effect took place right away . The air suddenly became incomparably heavier and oppressive silence descended to the place . Even the breathing of the mourners became incredibly cautious </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>" ". </p>
<p>All those people noisily yapping to each other promptly shut their mouths up at once </p>
<p>'Alright . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo succeeded in creating an acceptable atmosphere with nothing but a quiet display of power before he started walking forward again . He didn't get to walk for long, though, as a middle-aged lady, who was too young to be called a granny but too old to be called an auntie, stood before him </p>
<p>She was none other than Hunter Min Byung-Gu's mother </p>
<p>People began gasping softly as they looked on at the mother and Jin-Woo standing in an apparent face-off like that </p>
<p>'Uh, uh?'. </p>
<p>'Wait, she isn't going to scold him and chase him away, right?'. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the outcome people were worried about didn't come to pass . The why of it was simple enough </p>
<p>"You've arrived . Thank you for coming . ". </p>
<p>"Thank you for inviting me, ma'am . ". </p>
<p>It was actually Hunter Min-Byung-Gu's mother who pleaded with him to come by here today </p>
<p>"There was something I'd like to speak to you in person and that's why I had to make that call . I hope I wasn't troubling you . ". </p>
<p>"No, not at all, ma'am . ". </p>
<p>"Hunter-nim, I heard you got rid of all the monsters in that place so that my son could come home . ". </p>
<p>Min Byung-Gu's mother stopped there and gazed up at Jin-Woo, perhaps wanting to confirm the story she was told straight from the man himself </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo had various personal reasons for hunting down the ants of Jeju Island . However, it was also true that a part of him didn't want to see Hunter Min Byung-Gu rot away forgotten somewhere in the darkness of that ant tunnel . So, Jin-Woo quietly nodded his head </p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am . ". </p>
<p>"You helped my son so he won't sleep in that dark, damp place . I ". </p>
<p>Min Byung-Gu's mother finally began shedding the tears she'd been holding and continued on </p>
<p>"I was to able to meet my son for the last time with your help . Thank you very much, Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>There were no words that could console a parent grieving for her lost child . Jin-Woo could only remain silent with an agonised look on his face . In the meantime, the relatives of Min Byung-Gu's mother came over and carefully escorted her away deeper into the funeral venue </p>
<p>Even then, even as she was getting further away from him, she never stopped bowing to him to express her gratitude </p>
<p>'… . '. </p>
<p>For a moment there, the face of Min Byung-Gu's mother overlapped with that of his own mom's from ten years ago in Jin-Woo's eyes, back when she heard the news of his father going missing inside the Gate </p>
<p>A thick lump formed in his throat </p>
<p>'But '. </p>
<p>Just like how his father sacrificed his life to save a countless number of his colleagues, Hunter Min Byung-Gu's sacrifice wasn't in vain </p>
<p>Without his dedicated effort to heal his comrades, it'd have been really difficult for the Korean Hunters to walk out of the ant tunnel alive . Not only that, he used his powers to save the life of one more Hunter even in death </p>
<p>Min Byung-Gu's shadow actually felt relieved after it confirmed the colour of life gradually seep back into Hunter Cha Hae-In's complexion . From that alone, Jin-Woo could sense how much the Healer cared for his comrades </p>
<p>Coincidentally, Jin-Woo spotted Cha Hae-In in the distance as he quietly approached the black-and-white portrait of the deceased to lay down the flowers . But when their gazes met, she suddenly flinched and fell into a panicked state </p>
<p>'Did they come together?'. </p>
<p>The members of the Korean team around her sent him a silent greeting with a slight nod of their heads, but Cha Hae-In looked as if she had no clue which expression she was supposed to make right now </p>
<p>'Huh, so that woman can make a face like that, too?'. </p>
<p>He couldn't recall any other times when she didn't carry that expressionless face of hers . Indeed, one should get to know somebody for a longer time before passing judgement, that's for sure </p>
<p>Jin-Woo shifted his gaze away and stood before the portrait </p>
<p>Hunter Min Byung-Gu within the black photo frame was smiling brightly without a care in the world . Jin-Woo placed the flower in front of the portrait and closed his eyes for a brief moment </p>
<p>'I hope you find yourself in a better place . '. </p>
<p>Finishing up with the prayer for the departed, he turned around to see a familiar figure approach him from the distance </p>
<p>"Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>The low, bassy voice naturally belonged to the Association President, Goh Gun-Hui </p>
<p>"Sir . ". </p>
<p>"I was actually planning to give you a call later, but it's good that we have run into each other here . ". </p>
<p>"You wanted to see me?". </p>
<p>It was pretty obvious why the Association would look for a Hunter . Thinking that he might find himself with an opportunity to raise his level, Jin-Woo gazed at Goh Gun-Hui with anticipation, but regretfully, the Association President gently laughed and shook his head </p>
<p>"It's not what you're thinking about, Hunter-nim . ". </p>
<p>" Oh . I see . ". </p>
<p>How deflating, that </p>
<p>Jin-Woo could only ruefully smack his lips </p>
<p>"In any case, I'd like to speak to you for a moment or two . Will that be fine with you?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was planning to stop by the Association after leaving here to resolve his Guild Master licence problem anyway, so he said yes immediately </p>
<p>"I have business in the Association, so why don't we go and speak there?". </p>
<p>"You have business in the Association ? May I inquire what that is?". </p>
<p>"Oh, actually, I need a Guild Master licence, you see . ". </p>
<p>"Pardon?". </p>
<p>A question mark floated up above Goh Gun-Hui's head </p>
<p>"Why do you need the Guild Master licence when you already possess a rank S licence?". </p>
<p>"Wait, does that mean a rank S can establish a Guild without a licence?". </p>
<p>"Of course . ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui formed a good-natured smile and continued on </p>
<p>"If you wish to form your own Guild, all you have to do is to give the Association a call . We'll take care of the rest . ". </p>
<p>" . ". </p>
<p>The rank 'S' was a realm he never expected to step into half a year ago . So, it wasn't surprising to see Jin-Woo greatly underestimate all the cool benefits this rank came with </p>
<p>He was inwardly flustered after learning of something he didn't know until now, but </p>
<p>'But, this is actually for the better, isn't it . Let's find out more about all the benefits a rank S Hunter enjoys while I'm at it . '. </p>
<p>Also, seeing that he could directly get in touch with the Association President Goh Gun-Hui, he might be able to establish his Guild right away as long as he met the minimum requirements </p>
<p>Was this the reason why the old saying went on about finding the right backer if you wanted to succeed in life?. </p>
<p>Most people would never get to meet the President of the Hunter's Association in their lifetime, yet such a man had already become a dependable backer for Jin-Woo </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui continued on </p>
<p>"What I'd like to speak to you about won't take long, so we don't have to change the venue . ". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo nodded his head, leading Goh Gun-Hui to quickly ask him a question </p>
<p>"By any chance, have you cast some kind of a barrier spell over Jeju Island?". </p>
<p>"What do you mean?". </p>
<p>Where was this barrier magic thingy coming from, all of a sudden?. </p>
<p>Did something happen in Jeju Island after he killed every ant there and left for home?. </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui calmly explained what had happened </p>
<p>"During the operation to retrieve Hunter Min-Byung-Gu's remains, there was an incident of the military personnel and the accompanying Hunters losing their consciousness in the same location . Hmm, rather than losing consciousness, it'd be more appropriate to say that they had all fallen asleep, instead . ". </p>
<p>Everyone within the same location . all fell asleep? Jin-Woo could only tilt his head slightly </p>
<p>'Sounds like an AOE abnormal status magic, doesn't it?'. </p>
<p>… . It sounded similar to the thunder magic of the Demon King Baran that inflicted 'Stun' effect to all the Shadow Soldiers caught within the attack range </p>
<p>However, the problem lay with the fact that the folks present during that incident weren't your average Hunters </p>
<p>"I thought the elite members of the Knight Order were asked to go to Jeju Island?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo's question elicited a nod from Goh Gun-Hui </p>
<p>"They were either Hunters in the top of the rank A pile, or rank Bs who are very close to rank A in terms of their abilities . ". </p>
<p>To be able to put not just one, but several dozens of such people to sleep all at once – a regular rank S Mage wouldn't even dare to try performing a spell of that magnitude </p>
<p>"That's why I had to ask you about it, just in case . I was hoping that maybe you cast a barrier there but forgot to tell us about it . ". </p>
<p>Here was the solid proof that both Hunter's Association and its boss, Goh Gun-Hui, rated Jin-Woo's abilities incredibly high </p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, Jin-Woo's speciality didn't lay in casting debuff or abnormal status magic . And, perhaps more importantly, there was just no way that he'd forget about activating such a magic spell in the first place </p>
<p>Jin-Woo promptly shook his head </p>
<p>"I'm sorry . I haven't done that . ". </p>
<p>"I see I guess so . ". </p>
<p>Traces of worry slowly entered Goh Gun-Hui's expression . The most optimistic explanation he could think of turned out to be wide off the mark in the end </p>
<p>"What did the Hunters say, sir?". </p>
<p>"That is ". </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui formed a troubled face of a man finding it hard to explain something, before continuing on his explanations with some difficulty </p>
<p>"Not only the soldiers, but even the Hunters can't remember anything that happened before they lost their consciousness . ". </p>
<p>His voice sounded even more dispirited next </p>
<p>"Actually, we can't even figure out whether they were victims of a magic spell or not in the first place . ". </p>
<p>" . ". </p>
<p>If it were just the soldiers, who were simply regular people, it'd be possible to knock them out with something like the sleeping gas, but even the rank A Hunters and their exceptional physical abilities fell victim as well . So, it couldn't have been a conventional weapon of some kind </p>
<p>'Could it have been a trap left behind by the ants?'. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was really tempted to summon out Beru right now and ask him about it, but . </p>
<p>'… '. </p>
<p>If he did that, this funeral venue might morph into a blood-splattered battlefield in no time at all . The thing was, Jin-Woo could see a few dozen high-ranked Hunters around here just from a quick headcount </p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't worried about Beru at all . Nope, he was only concerned about the Hunters rashly trying to pick a fight with the former ant monster </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>A young man who must've been an Association employee approached them in hurried steps and whispered something to Goh Gun-Hui's ear . The Association President formed a rueful expression as he spoke to Jin-Woo </p>
<p>"A guest has arrived sooner than expected, and unfortunately, I must be on my way now . Thank you for your time . ". </p>
<p>"You too, sir . ". </p>
<p>After sharing brief goodbyes, Goh Gun-Hui hurriedly left the venue and disappeared from the view along with that unnamed employee </p>
<p>Now that he no longer had any reason to go to the Association, Jin-Woo figured that he might as well go home, instead . He too left the venue and began walking towards the location of the parked van </p>
<p>But, then . </p>
<p>'What's this?'. </p>
<p>He seemed to have picked up a somewhat puzzling 'tail' since from a short while ago . Jin-Woo tilted his head in confusion </p>
<p>'Aren't you supposed to do your best not to get discovered when tailing someone?'. </p>
<p>Not only that, any ol' regular folks wouldn't even dare to dream about tailing a rank S Hunter, too </p>
<p>Step, step . </p>
<p>Since he couldn't hear the roll of a camera, the person following him didn't seem to be a reporter . Heck, this person wasn't even trying to mask his presence, either </p>
<p>Getting curious about how long the tail would follow him, as well as what would this person do after catching up to him, Jin-Woo chose to keep walking over to the van without saying a word </p>
<p>And sure enough, the tail diligently followed after him </p>
<p>'Huh . Well, I'll be '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was getting more and more dumbfounded here . He even realised for the first time that he didn't want to deal seriously with someone who was this unprofessional at what he was supposed to do </p>
<p>However . </p>
<p>Just as Jin-Woo was about to grab the door handle of his van, he heard a voice calling out to him from behind </p>
<p>"Are you Mister Seong Jin-Woo?". </p>
<p>Jin-Woo smirked slightly and turned around while thinking to himself, 'Well, you've finally revealed your true colours, haven't you . '. </p>
<p>"Yes, I am . ". </p>
<p>But then, Jin-Woo was momentarily taken aback after confirming the face of his opponent </p>
<p>'He's a foreigner?'. </p>
<p>That man's Korean was so perfect that Jin-Woo didn't expect him to be a Westerner at all . Meanwhile, the young Westerner, sporting a business suit so slick that it bordered on being a fashion statement, formed a smile as bright as his golden hair colour </p>
<p>"This is who I am . ". </p>
<p>The man pulled out a business card and presented it to Jin-Woo . His name, the organisation he worked for, as well as his contact numbers, were all printed in large, legible letters on the card </p>
<p>[Senior Agent Adam White, Hunter Bureau, the United States of America]. </p>
<p>'Hunter Bureau??'. </p>
<p>What did an elite agent from the most powerful organisation in the US want from him now?. </p>
<p>'No . There's only one reason why the Hunter Bureau would want to speak to a Hunter . '. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo tore his eyes away from the card and looked straight at the agent, prompting the American to introduce himself with a sunny smile </p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim . Please call me Adam from now on . ". </p>
