<p>‘As I thought . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo nodded .  Before he had checked the description, he had surmised that the “storage” in its name meant that the skill would allow him to manage the soldiers somehow .  However, there was one thing he did not expect . </p>
<p>‘The limit is…’</p>
<p>The limits of the storage was smaller than the limits of the summoning .  While he could make 30 soldiers, he could only store 20 of them . That meant that he would have to get rid of 10 more . </p>
<p>‘Well that sucks . ’</p>
<p>It would be like biting of one of his fingers .  Even getting rid of just one soldier was painful, and now he had to get rid of 10 of them . </p>
<p>‘Hmm…’</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, Jinwoo looked over his army .  Of course, Ygritte and the mages would be excluded from selection .  That would leave the infantry . He decided to pick the 10 soldiers furthest away this time . </p>
<p>‘I’m sorry . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo briefly prayed for their souls . </p>
<p>shooooo-</p>
<p>The soldiers he selected became dust and scattered .  Compared to the first time, the regret that he felt was lessened .  They say humans can get used to anything . </p>
<p>Anyways . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked at the remaining soldiers and used ‘Shadow Storage’ . </p>
<p>At the activation of the skill, Ygritte and the Shadow Soldiers melted like ice into flat shadows .  Then, their shadows flowed over to Jinwoo and entered his own shadow . </p>
<p>‘So this is what the skill meant by absorbing them…!’</p>
<p>It was exactly as described by the skill; his army was absorbed into his shadow .  It all happened in a blink of an eye . The shadow army was nowhere to be seen . </p>
<p>‘ . Even after seeing it…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked at his shadow with amazement .  In that moment, the System rang . </p>
<p>ring~</p>

<p>‘Is it finally over…?’</p>
<p>It was a long and tough road .  Jinwoo took one last look around the Dungeon .  The traces of combat littered the area . </p>
<p>Broken knights .  Cracked walls . The destroyed pillar . </p>
<p>And the one who destroyed the pillar, the iron golem, which was now a pile of broken armor . </p>
<p>But his trials had resulted in many great boons . </p>
<p>New class and skills . </p>
<p>A powerful army . </p>
<p>A smile appeared on Jinwoo’s face .  He turned around without a lingering thought .  The gate to the real world waited for him . Jinwoo stepped through . </p>
<p>He returned to the clearing in the forest .  It was the same spot he had first entered the quest’s Dungeon .  The time was 5 AM . The sun would be rising soon . </p>
<p>Oh right . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked at his watch and kicked himself in his mind . </p>
<p>‘If I knew I was going to take this long, I should’ve let Jinah know . ’</p>
<p>Fortunately, he had been late in the past due to the Association’s Raids . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked behind him .  The gate that he left from had disappeared without a trace . </p>
<p>‘Huh…’</p>
<p>Looking at the empty clearing, everything that had happened felt like a dream . </p>
<p>Wait, a dream?</p>
<p>No, no way . </p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around . </p>
<p>Soldiers clad in pitch black surrounded him .  The Shadow Soldiers had come out the moment he thought of them in his head . </p>
<p>‘ . ’</p>
<p>At first, he thought of them as monsters . </p>
<p>Shadow Soldiers . </p>
<p>Monsters that were called from the shadows of the dead .  If they were monsters, what do you call the being that can freely create and control them? Jinwoo smiled,</p>
<p>‘Well, it doesn’t matter…’</p>
<p>He recalled the soldiers into his shadow again .  </p>
<p>The road home felt as easy as walking downhill . </p>
<p>Jinwoo slept for a long time .  He could not help it . The moment he had lied down in his bed, the day was already bright . </p>
<p>ring~ ring~</p>
<p>What woke him was the ringing of his phone .  He managed to grab it with much difficulty . Jinwoo answered the phone with his eyes still closed . </p>
<p>“Hello…”</p>
<p>His tired voice cracked a bit . </p>
<p>- “What the… Oppa, are you still sleeping? Do you know what time it is?!”</p>
<p>Jinah asked with surprise from the other end, so Jinwoo asked . </p>
<p>“What time is it…”</p>
<p>- “It’s 2 PM!”</p>
<p>“Whaaa?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo peaked at the phone through a crack in his eyes .  She was right . </p>
<p>- “Oppa, you do remember that you have to come to the school today, right?”</p>
<p>Her voice was filled with concern .  This made Jinwoo finally sit-up on the bed . </p>
<p>“When do I have to be there by?”</p>
<p>- “5!”</p>
<p>“Alright, I won’t be late . Don’t worry . ”</p>
<p>- “As expected of my brother! Call me when you get here!”</p>
<p>Jinah cutely ended the call . </p>
<p>Jinwoo scratched his head and slowly got up .  He could probably make it if he got ready now . </p>
<p>‘Still, I’m about to go see my little sister’s teacher . ’</p>
<p>On top of that, it was for the parent/guardian meeting for a highschool senior .  They say this was one of the most important meetings of a child’s life . </p>
<p>‘I can’t go looking like this . ’</p>
<p>He went over and looked through his wardrobe .  A musty scent filled his nose; it was not exactly a good smell .  Jinwoo’s forehead wrinkled . The most suitable thing he found was the old suit that he had worn for his graduation . </p>
<p>‘Can I wear this?’</p>
<p>He tried it on, but it did not fit .  The suit was too small for his body . </p>
<p>‘Man, my body really grew . ’</p>
<p>Trying on his old clothes was a sure way to tell .  The suit felt like it was about to rip apart over him . </p>
<p> . Now what?</p>
<p>While wondering what he could wear, Jinwoo’s eyes fell on the bankbook that Yoo Jinho had given him .  It contained the magic core income from their Raids . Looking back and forth between the old suit and the bankbook, a smile crept up on Jinwoo’s face . </p>
<p>‘It’s been a while . Shall I go shopping?’</p>
<p>However, there was something small he had to check .  Wait, not small, something big . Jinwoo took off the suit and sat down on his bed and opened up the status screen . </p>
<p>‘Status screen . ’</p>
<p>An information box filled a bunch of words filled his view . </p>

<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo stuck out a tongue at the status screen that went on and on . </p>
<p>‘I feel like only few days ago this was nearly empty . ’</p>
<p>It was true .  But now, just the skills and equipment alone had increased greatly .  Above all else, what stood out to him was his new class . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Class: Monarch of Shadows</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>Just yesterday, this spot was decorated with word, “none” .  To be honest, everytime he opened his status screen, that “none” bothered him .  A Hunter that didn’t Raid was basically an unemployed bum . At least, that’s how society viewed them .  So when he looked at his status screen before and saw that he had no class(job), it struck a chord in his mind .  Now, he could not hide his joy in looking at the newly filled part of his status screen . </p>
<p>‘Is this what they call an inferiority complex?’</p>
<p>Of course, having “none” in that section didn’t mean that he didn’t have a job in real life .  Still, it reminded him of his past . Other Hunters raided and earned a ton of money without paying attention to the eyes of the world .  He was the not the same . He could not even proudly claim that he was a Hunter . After all, he was a mere E-ranker who could barely hold onto his own life . </p>
<p>“Hello, I’m an E-rank Hunter . ”</p>
<p>Every time those words escaped his mouth, anyone who knew anything about Hunters would praise him for his hard work but go on to mock him behind his back .  That’s why not having a class bothered him, despite how illogical it was . </p>
<p>But now, he had obtained a job, or rather something special .  His job was still a Hunter, but in a way, he had obtained a special calling called the “Monarch of Shadows” . </p>
<p>‘Even if it’s not exactly what I was hoping for…’</p>
<p>He had no regrets .  If anything, he was satisfied .  If he wasn’t in his room, he would’ve summoned Ygritte and the Shadow Soldiers before him .  Jinwoo really wanted to test out their capabilities in battle . What if they could bring out a 100% of their former powers?</p>
<p>‘Probably not . ’</p>
<p>But even imagining it made his heart race . </p>
<p>ba dum ba dum</p>
<p>Jinwoo stood still and felt his heartbeat .  In his head, he was running simulations of his next Raid .  Additionally, he was looking forward to Yoo Jinho’s reaction . </p>
<p>Imagining the young man’s face with wide open eyes and mouth, Jinwoo laughed despite of himself . </p>
<p>Hold on . </p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it . ’</p>
<p>If he was able to raise a dead target, and if that target was not limited to a monster or a magic beast…</p>
<p>‘I should be able to raise a soldier from a dead Hunter, right?’</p>
<p>It was obvious, but he had avoided the idea because a human was involved .  To think that he would command an undead soldier from a dead man’s shadow . Just the idea shocked him . </p>
<p>Even still…</p>
<p>‘What if I can raise an A-rank or a S-rank Hunter’s shadow?’</p>
<p>The power he would obtain would be beyond imagination .  Even if the soldier could wield just 50% of their former powers, it would be enough for him to raid high-level Dungeons .  The light racing of his heart turned to a full sprint . </p>
<p>BA DUM, BA DUM, BA DUM!</p>
<p>But Jinwoo shook his head . </p>
<p>‘Still, raising a human being into an undead is…’</p>
<p>It was not something that should be done .  No matter how much it increased his powers, he wanted to avoid doing that .  Unless someone appeared that truly deserved it…</p>
<p>‘Not that there are a lot of opportunities to fight another Hunter . ’</p>
<p>Even if an opportunity appeared, there was a philosophical problem .  Humans were not monsters or magic beasts . </p>
<p>Alright . </p>
<p>For now, he would be satisfied with the army on hand . </p>
<p>‘I did obtain a boss-level soldier too . ’</p>
<p>The Shadow Soldier who was level 7 and a knight grade .  How powerful was he?</p>
<p>Jinwoo anticipated his next Raid . </p>
