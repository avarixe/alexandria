<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 69</p>
<p>Next morning, Jinwoo went straight to Daesung Tower . </p>
<p>‘Man, it’s still so tall . ’</p>
<p>A skyscraper with a hundred floors .  Standing near it, you’d have to strain your neck to look up to the top . </p>
<p>‘There are a lot of people here today . ’</p>
<p>Compared to the last time he had come here, there were a lot more people around .  Guess that was the literal difference between night and day . Whether it was the lobby, entrance or the sidewalk, people came and went nonstop . </p>
<p>‘Man, if I just disappeared into thin air like last time, it’ll cause quite a commotion . ’</p>
<p>There were already many eyes looking for him because of this so-called “unknown helper” incident .  Was there a need for him to reveal himself and purposely attract attention?</p>
<p>‘Of course not . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo did not enjoy having attention focused on him .  He walked over to a hidden corner and took out the Demon Castle Key .  It was a slender, golden key . At a casual glance, it was clearly nonfunctional . </p>
<p>‘No one’s looking, right?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked around and nodded . </p>
<p>‘Time to go . ’</p>
<p>The Hunter used the ‘Stealth’ skill . </p>
<p>shooo-</p>
<p>The invisible man came out of his hiding spot then made his way through the crowd to the building .  Because of how packed the streets were, he couldn’t avoid bumping into few people here and there, but none of them paid any mind . </p>
<p>‘Man, this skill can be used for some really bad things . ’</p>
<p>No wonder high-rankers with ‘Stealth’ were under a lot of surveillance . </p>
<p>flaaaare!</p>
<p>In the meantime, he passed through the invisible threshold into a completely different world . </p>
<p>‘If I can hear the flames from here, just how hot is it?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked up at the massive tower on fire .  It stood where Daesung Tower was moments ago . The Demon Castle nearly filled his entire vision .  Still, they say humans can get used to anything . </p>
<p>‘Feels less oppressive than last time . ’</p>
<p>Indeed, Jinwoo’s anxiousness was practically nonexistent this time . </p>
<p>Or perhaps,</p>
<p>‘It’s because I’ve grown that much . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo returned the golden Demon Castle Key to the inventory then took out a gray key . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Castle Gate Key</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: A-rank</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>Type: Key</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>It is the key to the Demon Castle’s gates . </strong>.   </p>
<p>Obtained after killing the Gatekeeper . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>It was what he obtained after killing the watchdog, Cerberus .  He was unable to use it in the past, having just barely defeated Cerberus .  Now, he would finally enter the castle . Next, he took out his weapon . Baruka’s Tanto in his right hand, the gate key in his left, Jinwoo carefully walked towards the castle gate .  Curiously, he did not see Cerberus . </p>
<p>‘Do monsters not respawn in the Demon Castle Dungeon?’</p>
<p>Might be just limited to the dog, but there was a strong possibility that it was a special rule of this place . </p>
<p>‘If that’s the case…’</p>
<p>The interiors might be a little different than the Instant Dungeons where monsters respawned .  Jinwoo sharply focused his senses . </p>
<p>BA DUM BA DUM BA DUM!</p>
<p>Because of the sense stat that had reached over a hundred, focusing his senses made his own heartbeat sound like thunder . </p>
<p>‘But I am not afraid . ’</p>
<p>Compared to the past, what he felt now was not fear but an overwhelming confidence resulting from his power .  Maintaining a sharpness and being afraid were two completely different things . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>A message appeared in front of the castle door . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to use the Castle Gate Key and enter? (Y/N)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘No, miss System, I’ll just turn back and go home . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo laughed at the stupid question and selected “Yes” . </p>
<p>creaaaak-</p>
<p>He had not touched the door, but the giant gates swung open on their own . </p>
<p>Clunk!</p>
<p>‘Huh…?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo was taken back .  Even though his senses were focused, he did not sense any monsters past the doors . </p>
<p>‘No monsters?’</p>
<p>He had prepared for the exact opposite .  His worst case scenario visioned a scene where a ton of monsters jumped him the moment he opened the door .  It was this pessimistic thought that had carried him to the penalty zone for training . </p>
<p>‘But…’</p>
<p>Just what was this? It seemed like his efforts were in vain .  The inside of the castle was almost pathetically devoid of any monsters’ presence . </p>
<p>‘Huh… What now?’</p>
<p>With a disappointed feeling, Jinwoo returned Baruka’s Tanto to the inventory and stepped into the Demon Castle .  As these things usually go, that first step into the area triggered the response . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>Jinwoo reflexively called his two daggers to his hands in a flash . </p>
<p>‘What! What is it?!’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>A quest has arrived . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘A quest?’</p>
<p>And it’s not the daily quest? Well that would’ve been weird; he had already made sure to complete the daily quest before coming here .  Then this must be… just a quest . </p>
<p>This was the first time he had received “just” a quest . </p>
<p>‘Every other quest up until now was hidden, emergency or something . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo checked the quest with a tilted head . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Ordinary Quest: Collect the Demon Souls! Part 1</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The Demon Castle is full of demons . Please hunt them and collect their souls to earn a special reward . Normal demons contain only one soul, but the upper floors will have demons with multiple souls . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Quest Requirement: Enter the Demon Castle</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Quest Goal: Demon Souls 0 / 10,000</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rewards:</strong>. </p>
<p>Pick one item from every item possible</p>
<p>Stat points +20</p>
<p>Unknown Reward</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>20 Stat points! As always, the first thing that grabbed Jinwoo’s attention was the stat point reward . </p>
<p>‘I can raise my intelligence by 20!’</p>
<p>He could not help but smile .  The disadvantages of low mana could not be understated . </p>
<p>‘I need a ton of mana to keep my soldiers regenerating . ’</p>
<p>And mana wasn’t the only benefit of the intelligence stat .  Jinwoo was finally able to learn that as his intelligence increased, the number of shadows he could extract and store increased as well[1] .  Because of all this, increasing his intelligence was urgent . </p>
<p>‘There’s a limit with just level-ups and daily quests…’</p>
<p>If he could earn 20 bonus stats through the quest, it would take care of a large problem . </p>
<p>gulp</p>
<p>‘And…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo looked up from the stat reward . </p>
<p>“Pick one item from every item possible”</p>
<p>Just the bonus stats were an insane reward, then there was this . </p>
<p>‘Really? Every item possible?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo remembered the absolute highest-class equipments from the shop . </p>
<p>‘There were even…’</p>
<p>S-rank equipment that cost billions, some even tens of billions, of gold .  Jinwoo looked at Knight Killer in his left hand . This powerful dagger cost nearly three million gold, and he was still using it . </p>
<p>‘If a B-rank dagger costing nearly three million is this good, just how good are the S-rank daggers costing tens of billions?’</p>
<p>He became curious .  Looking at just the first and second rewards, even ignoring the unknown third reward, this was an incredible quest . </p>
<p>‘Considering the rewards, taking down few monsters will be as easy as eating-’</p>
<p>Because Jinwoo’s eyes fell on the quest rewards first, he had not taken a closer look at the quest goal .  The man finally looked at the number of zeros and was shocked . </p>
<p>“Ten… thousand?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo could not help but exclaim loudly .  This was not just “taking down few monsters” . </p>
<p>‘It’s really, really not an ordinary quest . ’</p>
<p>No matter what kind of monsters these demons were, killing ten thousand of them would be an ordeal .  However, the Hunter smiled widely . </p>
<p>‘That is… if I was alone . ’</p>
<p>The current number of soldiers was 50 .  They each just had to take down 200 demons .  Yes, with those soldiers, this quest would be doable . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Would you like to accept the quest?</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘Of course . ’</p>
<p>There was no way he would refuse . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve accepted the quest . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>If he failed, the “penalty” would be just the wasted time . </p>
<p>‘Compared the penalty of those other quests… bleh…’</p>
<p>His life was on the line for the Class Advancement Quest and the Emergency Quests .  Compared to those, this was truly a blessed quest . Jinwoo raised his head,</p>
<p>‘So that’s going to keep track of my progress?’</p>
<p>The moment he accepted the quest, a counter appeared in the air . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Collected Demon Souls: 0 / 10,000</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘10,000… This’ll be a long road . ’</p>
<p>With the numbers he imagined in his head actually visualized, Jinwoo chuckled in disbelief .  Suddenly, he discovered another counter to the left to the souls counter . </p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Exp . to Next Level: 60,000</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>The holographic letters clearly displayed a number, and it was telling him that he would level up once he filled that number . </p>
<p>‘Am I finally able to see my experience?’</p>
<p>But he was Level 61 .  61 didn’t particularly seem like a milestone level for something like this to happen .  Not only that, Jinwoo didn’t see such a counter before heading into the Demon Castle . </p>
<p>‘Let’s see…’</p>
<p>Jinwoo took a step back and exited the Demon Castle .  With that, both the soul counter and the experience counter disappeared .  When he went back in, the two counters returned as if they were always there . </p>
<p>‘Looks like it’s only for the Demon Castle . ’</p>
<p>It was a shame he wouldn’t be able to see the experience counter on the outside, but it would surely be convenient while he was in here .  On the other hand,</p>
<p>‘Does that mean it’ll take that long to conquer this place?’</p>
<p>That was certainly a possibility .  Jinwoo pored over the details of the quest once more, then closed the message box . </p>
<p>‘Think I got the details down . ’</p>
<p>Finally, it would be time to explore the interiors of the Demon Castle . </p>
<p>‘Whoa!’</p>
<p>wooooooooo-</p>
<p>A ruined city lay before his eyes .  Unexpectedly, it was another field-type Dungeon . </p>
<p>‘Where is this? Is this Seoul?’</p>
<p>Perhaps if everyone in Seoul died and a hundred years passed, it might look like this .  A lifeless city faded to gray . Few street lights flickered on and off here and there . </p>
<p>‘To think that it’d be another field-type Dungeon…’</p>
<p>On top of that, it was using the great city of Seoul as its base .  Next to the Instant Dungeons that used a subway station or a mall as their base, this was incomparable .  Jinwoo’s eyes narrowed . </p>
<p>‘Where do I go first?’</p>
<p>Where was the goal? Jinwoo looked over here and there .  Thankfully, he did not have to wonder for too long . From a distance, where Namsan Tower should’ve been, a giant pillar of light stood in its place . </p>
<p>‘Let’s try over there . ’</p>
<p>Jinwoo started heading towards the direction .  In case he got lost, he carefully remembered the area where the castle gate was .  However, he did not go too far when he was interrupted,</p>
<p>“Kik kik . ”</p>
<p>“Kikikik . ”</p>
<p>Small monsters crawled out from between the buildings here and there . </p>
<p>‘Low-level Demon’</p>
<p>Jinwoo read the dark red names above their heads and understood what they were . </p>
<p>‘They look like…’</p>
<p>If the gargoyle magic beasts had wings, it would look just like them .  There were eight of them . Jinwoo smiled . </p>
<p>‘Got eight souls . ’</p>
<p>Pierce!</p>
<p>One of the demons sported Baruka’s Tanto out of its forehead . </p>
<p>.  . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated a Low-level Demon . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve earned 100 experience points . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve earned 1 Demon Soul . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“Kiak?”</p>
<p>“Kiek?”</p>
<p>While they were distracted by their fallen comrade, Jinwoo quickly ran over and removed another’s head . </p>
<p>slash!</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve defeated a Low-level Demon . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve earned 100 experience points . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>You’ve earned 1 Demon Soul . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>These things gave a hundred experience points each . </p>
<p>‘And I need 60,000 experience points to level-up…’</p>
<p>Defeating 600 of these low-level demons should level him up .  The remaining demons fell quickly . </p>
<p>“Kiiiiiiek!”</p>
<p>“Kek!”</p>
<p>Current souls at 8 .  Experienced gained was 800 . </p>
<p>‘Not a bad start . ’</p>
<p>A marathon starts with just a few steps .  Jinwoo’s eyes sparkled, looking for the next prey . </p>
<p>Baekho Guild .  Guildmaster’s Office . </p>
<p>After being busy for the past few days, Baek Yoonho was going through the documents and reports that he had been neglecting . </p>
<p>Beep-</p>
<p>He picked up the phone . </p>
<p>- “Guildmaster, Hunter Min Byunggu-nim is calling . Would you like me to connect?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please . ”</p>
<p>- “Alright . ”</p>
<p>A moment later, a familiar voice came from the receiver . </p>
<p>- “Baek hyung, why is your cellphone off?”</p>
<p>Baek Yoonho sighed deeply,</p>
<p>“Because of those damn reporters . I’m going dark until this damn story dies down . ”</p>
<p>- “Oh, yeah, that! Red Gate! I saw the news from Japan . Hyung, you look pretty good on the TV . ”</p>
<p>“Don’t test me . I’m not in the mood to joke around . Once I find who leaked that story, I’m going to just…”</p>
<p>- “Don’t worry about that too much, hyung . That story’s going to get pushed over by a big news soon . ”</p>
<p>“A big news? From Japan?”</p>
<p>- “Yeah . The problem is worse than we thought . It’s going to make waves in Korea soon . ”</p>
<p>“Why? What happened?”</p>
<p>A week ago, Japan secretly contacted the Korean Hunter Association and the large Guilds of South Korea .  They were informed that Japan needed a consultation with Korea’s Hunters . And so, several Hunters representing Korea headed over to Japan for a meeting .  Min Byunggu was one of those Hunters . Baek Yoonho had been curious about the matter,</p>
<p>“Stop messing around and spill it . This is the first time those Japanese bastards asked for our advice on something . Just what’s going on over there that could rattle those arrogant fucks?” [2]</p>
<p>- “Baek hyung, you remember the ants of Jeju Island, right?”</p>
<p>An S-rank Gate underwent a Dungeon Break four years ago on Jeju Island .  The Dungeon was populated by ant type magic beasts . South Korea had attempted to reclaim the island three times .  They failed three times . Eventually, the government gave up on the jewel of Korea, and Jeju Island became the land of the magic beasts . </p>
<p>“How could I forget? I almost died during one of the reclamation efforts . ”</p>
<p>- “There’s been a development in that area . ”</p>
<p>“Development? Who the hell cares . Let them kill and eat each other on that island . ”</p>
<p>- “That’s…”</p>
<p>The voice on the phone became filled with worry and continued,</p>
<p>- “They discovered a corpse of a winged ant on the coast of Japan . ” [3]</p>
<p>  . </p>
<p>Translator’s Notes:</p>
<p>[1]: Oh, here it is . The actual confirmation that intelligence increased his maximum shadows . </p>
<p>[2]: Err, in case anyone’s uncomfortable with the rather blatant racism, the relationship between Korean and Japan, especially for older folks, is not that good . </p>
<p>[3]: In the next arc of SoloxLeveling, we’ll be visiting the Chimera Ant Island :P</p>
