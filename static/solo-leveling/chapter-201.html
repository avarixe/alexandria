<h3>Chapter 201: Chapter 201</h3> <p>Jin-Woo had a bit of history with the monsters called Ice Elves </p>
<p>Didn’t he encounter these creatures when he stumbled into a Red Gate for the first time in his life? How rueful did he feel back then, after seeing the boss mob ‘Baruka’ slipping out of his hands while leaving only a dagger behind?. </p>
<p>Just remembering that event brought back all the bad emotions he felt then after failing to extract that monster’s shadow </p>
<p>‘And here I was, having just barely forgotten about it… . ’. </p>
<p>Naturally, his strength while gripping this creature’s wrist and neck increased </p>
<p>Wuduk!. </p>
<p>[Keok!]. </p>
<p>In any case, why was a high-ranking monster that should have been confined to a dungeon roaming freely around here?. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo got here by switching his position with his Shadow Soldier . Next up, he used ‘Ruler’s Authority’ to keep his balance and float in the air about 7 or 8 stories high . While gripping the monster tightly, he asked this mysterious Ice Elf a question </p>
<p>“What the hell are you?”. </p>
<p>Seeing those pointy ears, or the long whitish hair, or even its pair of silvery eyes, this thing seemed to be a White Phantom alright, but then again, he could also sense the trace of an unfathomably lengthy passage of time from this creature, too </p>
<p>Not only that… </p>
<p>[Kuwuaaahk!]. </p>
<p>The monster gritted its teeth and shook off Jin-Woo’s hands </p>
<p>‘… . !!’. </p>
<p>What an incredible physical strength!. </p>
<p>Even before he had the chance to get surprised from the monster slipping out of his grasp, Jin-Woo picked up on this chilling aura coagulating around the creature’s mouth </p>
<p>Inexplicably, the image of Demon King Baran shooting lightning out of its mouth overlapped with this b*stard . By sheer instinct, Jin-Woo tilted his torso away </p>
<p>Kawahh-!!. </p>
<p>The bitterly cold air shot out from the monster’s mouth, sped past Jin-Woo’s original position, and poured out into the air behind him </p>
<p>After confirming the scary amount of magical energy being poured out by the monster with his two eyes, Jin-Woo quickly retreated an adequate-enough distance away </p>
<p>‘… ’. </p>
<p>He lightly dusted the particles of ice clinging onto his shoulder and stared intently at the Ice Elf – no, the Sovereign of Frost </p>
<p>That thing was no ordinary monster . His ultra-sharp senses were warning him that this thing was much stronger than any monster he had faced off against so far </p>
<p>Jin-Woo wasn’t the only one getting surprised, though </p>
<p>[But, how can you… . ??]. </p>
<p>The Sovereign hurriedly looked at Jin-Woo’s shadow and, after confirming the number of soldiers hiding in there, couldn’t hide the fact that it was feeling deeply surprised right now </p>
<p>[You have managed to amass that many soldiers, so why haven’t you contacted us already?]. </p>
<p>When Jin-Woo made no effort to reply, the Sovereign began looking into his eyes . And then, a pained gasp leaked out from the creature’s mouth </p>
<p>[So, that’s how it was… . You’re the variable he talked about, aren’t you?]. </p>
<p>What was this fool talking about?. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was getting rather curious about the meaning behind this monster’s constant babbling, but too bad, he didn’t have enough leeway to hold a cordial Q&amp;A session with this creature  </p>
<p>Just one moment of carelessness and the enemy’s blade would reach him . And that blade wasn’t dull enough for him to ignore it and hope for the best . As a matter of fact, his shoulder that got frozen for a moment just a few seconds ago was still aching even now </p>
<p>Jin-Woo took a glance at the hurting shoulder and quietly summoned the ‘Demon King’s Shortswords’ from his Inventory </p>
<p>Weapons silently appeared in his hands </p>
<p>‘Is it a Mage-type creature?’. </p>
<p>Judging from how it barely managed to get out of his grasp, its physical strength or defences didn’t seem to be as high as its magical energy reserve suggested </p>
<p>Which was a relief, actually </p>
<p>He knew from his vast experiences in fighting many different types of monsters up until now that the Mage-type enemies were the easiest to deal with since they could be killed in an instant </p>
<p>Just one hit would be enough to determine the winner </p>
<p>If they both possessed a similar level of magical energy reserves, then the one needing to dodge the magic attacks would hold an advantage </p>
<p>His opponent must’ve known that too because it didn’t immediately try to go on the offensive, even though it had clearly sensed Jin-Woo’s hostility </p>
<p>The Sovereign of Frost deliberated on its options very seriously – but, only for a brief time – before deciding on what it would do next </p>
<p>[… . We shall stop here . I didn’t come here today to hold a life-or-death struggle with you . ]. </p>
<p>“What was that??”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo frowned deeply . He had no desire to let this guy leave, so just who decided when they would stop fighting?. </p>
<p>Besides, this creature wielded a massive amount of magic energy . Jin-Woo couldn’t even begin to imagine just how many experience points he’d earn if he successfully killed this monster . His level might even jump up by another ten, just like back when he killed the King of Giants </p>
<p>‘… . Hang on . ’. </p>
<p>When his thoughts arrived there, Jin-Woo finally deduced the identity of the monster </p>
<p>‘Could that thing be… . ??’. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Sovereign pointed towards the broken wall of the Hunter’s Association building </p>
<p>[Did you not come here to save that human?]. </p>
<p>Technically speaking, he came here because the ant soldier he left behind in the Association President’s shadow sent him an urgent alert, that was all </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s gaze shifted towards the location the Sovereign’s outstretched finger was pointing at . And he found Goh Gun-Hui lying on the floor there </p>
<p>‘… . !!’. </p>
<p>The unconscious Association President was covered in blood from head to toe, and even at a casual glance, he could tell that the man’s life was hanging precariously on the edge </p>
<p>It was then </p>
<p>[Now, choose . ]. </p>
<p>A large, incredibly sharp ice lance suddenly formed on the left hand of the Sovereign </p>
<p>[Choose between fighting me or saving that human . ]. </p>
<p>The moment the creature’s words came to an end, the lance flew towards Goh Gun-Hui </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s eyes widened . He pushed his concentration to the absolute max, causing the flow of time to slow down greatly . He watched the lance fly agonisingly slowly, but accurately, towards the unmoving Association President </p>
<p>‘Ruler’s Authority!’. </p>
<p>He tried to use his invisible hand to stop the ice lance, but the magical energy of the one who threw it easily thwarted his attempts . Enraged, Jin-Woo shifted his glare at the Sovereign of Frost </p>
<p>The b*stard was waiting . For Jin-Woo’s answer, that was </p>
<p>He bit his lower lip before dashing towards the spot where the Association President Goh Gun-Hui had collapsed on </p>
<p>Wuuwung-!!. </p>
<p>The air where Jin-Woo used to be wavered and tumbled about from the explosive power . Just before the lance landed, he arrived by Goh Gun-Hui’s side first with almost no time to spare and dragged the unmoving man away from the weapon’s trajectory </p>
<p>Kwajeeck!!. </p>
<p>The lance stabbed straight through the floor and the bitter coldness rapidly flooded out to freeze up the surroundings in an instant </p>
<p>Kwa-du-duk, kwa-duk!!. </p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the entire floor of the President’s office froze up solid from the extremely low temperature </p>
<p>‘D*mn it!’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo picked Goh Gun-Hui up and lightly jumped up in the air to avoid the freeze, and once this incredible biting coldness stopped spreading around, he settled back down on the floor </p>
<p>Further enraged by this cheap tactic, Jin-Woo raised his head to look, but the b*stard was already jumping into a small Gate to escape from this battle </p>
<p>In a rush, he quickly summoned ‘Baruka’s Dagger’ from the Inventory and threw it </p>
<p>‘Dagger Rush!’. </p>
<p>Swishhhh-!. </p>
<p>The dagger flew in a dead-straight line and accurately stabbed into the Sovereign’s shoulder </p>
<p>[Kuwahk!!]. </p>
<p>The Sovereign of Frost glared at the dagger in its shoulder, then glared at the one who threw it next – at Jin-Woo – and gnashed its teeth . It soon disappeared into the depth of the Gate </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was thinking of chasing after the creature, but seeing the Gate’s gradually shrink in size, he gave up on that idea . Besides, Goh Gun-Hui’s current condition wasn’t good enough for him to focus his attention elsewhere </p>
<p>“Euh-euhk… . ”. </p>
<p>The older man gasped out a pained moan </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s lips closed shut in a straight line as he watched the Association President Goh Gun-Hui teeter precariously on the edge of life and death </p>
<p>‘This can’t be healed with a healing potion . ’. </p>
<p>In that case, the best response he could come up with was to… </p>
<p>… . Jin-Woo yelled out at the top of his lungs </p>
<p>“Beru!”. </p>
<p>Right away, he sensed the familiar aura hurriedly fly out from his apartment from a far away </p>
<p>Kwa-boom!!. </p>
<p>Beru smashed past several walls after flying in with all his might and entered the President’s office, before kneeling down in front of Jin-Woo </p>
<p>“Have you called for me, oh, my king?”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo cautiously lowered Goh Gun-Hui’s upper torso on the floor and took a step back </p>
<p>There was so much blood dripping out from the Association President that Jin-Woo’s hands were now painted crimson just from supporting the older man’s torso for a few seconds </p>
<p>Drip, drip… </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s complexion grew gloomier as he stared at the droplets of blood fall to the floor from his fingertips </p>
<p>Beru did as his master willed it and approached Goh Gun-Hui . He began using up all of his magical energy healing the gravely injured man </p>
<p>Wuuonng… Wuuwuong…. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the complexion of the dying man didn’t want to improve at all even with such a concerted healing effort . Beru panicked and opened his mouth </p>
<p>“M-my king… . ”. </p>
<p>Beru’s scared eyes shifted over to Jin-Woo as he spoke </p>
<p>“My healing magic… isn’t working on him . I can’t heal this man . ”. </p>
<p>“What??”. </p>
<p>He didn’t seem to be exaggerating, because Beru’s hands were shuddering as he continued on with his healing magic . Even Jin-Woo could sense the enormous amount of Beru’s magic energy being spent right now . At this rate, even the former ant king would keel over from exhaustion </p>
<p>Jin-Woo halted the healing effort and sat down next to Goh Gun-Hui to take a closer look at the man’s current condition . Despite Beru’s near-selfless efforts, the Association President’s vitality had weakened even further than before </p>
<p>Whatever that attack was, the hole in Goh Gun-Hui’s chest didn’t want to close up even after Jin-Woo poured in a whole bottle of the most expensive healing potion sold in the Store </p>
<p>‘D*mn it!’. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s breathing became urgent as the critical moment for Goh Gun-Hui approached closer and closer . The man who did his best for Jin-Woo’s sake was slipping away and he couldn’t do anything </p>
<p>Out of sheer desperation, he even summoned out the bottle of ‘Divine Water of Life’, but before he could use it, someone grasped his wrist </p>
<p>“Please… . stop . ”. </p>
<p>It was Goh Gun-Hui . He managed somehow to force his eyes open </p>
<p>“Association President!”. </p>
<p>His breathing remained heavy as if it was on the brink of cutting out . He still got to confirm the faces of Jin-Woo and Beru next to him, though </p>
<p>“… . You did come for me . Thank you . ”. </p>
<p>A weak smile spread on Goh Gun-Hui’s face </p>
<p>“Please, hold on for a little bit longer . I’ll take you to a hospital right now . ”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo’s urgent voice only managed to earn a shake of Goh Gun-Hui’s head </p>
<p>“It’s useless… the attack that got me far exceeds the level of being curable with medicine or magic . ”. </p>
<p>“But, sir!”. </p>
<p>Jin-Woo was about to get angry after hearing those words of weakness from the Association President, but he had to stop . Goh Gun-Hui’s trembling hand was grasping his, that was why </p>
<p>“Listen to me!”. </p>
<p>As if he was spurring on the dying embers of life for one last hurrah, Goh Gun-Hui’s brows rose up high, his eyes opening up wide </p>
<p>“I was able to get in touch with the will of the great beings . I saw their plans, who our common enemies are, and the things that we must do… . ”. </p>
<p>The blood pooling in Goh Gun-Hui mouth gurgled and welled up </p>
<p>“What a relief that you’re here with us… to think, you’d possess that kind of power… . Thank you, God… . ”. </p>
<p>Tears began welling up in Goh Gun-Hui’s eyes as he stared at Jin-Woo . He then grasped the young Hunter’s hand with both of his own and spoke with a trembling voice </p>
<p>“Gates and dungeons weren’t for them . In order to protect us, they chose this method, and… . Cough… . ”. </p>
<p>At that moment, Goh Gun-Hui coughed and reddish-black blood spluttered out from his mouth </p>
<p>Jin-Woo hurriedly tried to use the Divine Water, but Goh Gun-Hui shook his head . He knew the condition of his own body better than anyone </p>
<p>“Sometime in the future… there will come a time when you must make a decision . When you do… I pray that you remain on the side of mankind . ”. </p>
<p>Hearing the pained gasping voice of Goh Gun-Hui, Jin-Woo felt as if his heart was being ripped to pieces . But, all he could do right now was to quietly listen to his words . That’s all he could do </p>
<p>“Cough . I always wished I could fight alongside young people like you . But… . This body of mine made sure that would never happen . ”. </p>
<p>For the first time ever, Goh Gun-Hui poured out what was in his heart without holding back </p>
<p>Some people pointed their disapproving fingers at him, accusing him of establishing the Association to rake in more money . Some even insulted him as a senile old fool who was blinded by the allure of power </p>
<p>The thing was, the man they were criticising was feeling angry that, even though he was blessed with this incredible power, he couldn’t even use it properly </p>
<p>He sought out other avenues to use his powers and, after spending every cent to his name, created the Hunter’s Association . And through this organisation, he got to be near other Hunters and fulfilled his calling to its fullest </p>
<p>“Even then, cough, I don’t regret anything . I can now entrust the future to young people like you . That’s all I ask for . ”. </p>
<p>Drop… </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui’s hands holding onto Jin-Woo’s powerlessly fell to the floor . And he was no longer staring at the young man, but at the ceiling of his office </p>
<p>Was it because his tears had spread out? The lights hanging on the ceiling, the ones he always thought were a bit too dim for his liking, seemed excessively blinding today </p>
<p>Goh Gun-Hui shielded his eyes to block those lights </p>
<p>“I’m truly relieved… . Thank you, thank you… . ”. </p>
<p>At the end of those words, the Association President Goh Gun-Hui stopped murmuring altogether </p>
<p>Confirming that he was no longer breathing now, Jin-Woo wordlessly closed the deceased man’s unmoving eyes shut . Like his final words of gratitude, the expression on his face was one of peace </p>
<p>Jin-Woo raised his head above to stare outside </p>
<p>Drip, drip…. </p>
<p>He saw through the destroyed wall the raindrops falling from the cloudy sky . The sky that had been gloomy since the early morning </p>
<p>***. </p>
<p>Next day . Several headlines dominated the front pages of countless newspapers </p>
<p>The first news item was about Brazil’s greatest Hunter, ‘Jonas’ being found on the vicinity of a river – as a corpse . The second one was about the grisly murder of the Korean Hunter’s Association President after his chest was stabbed through by an unidentified assailant </p>
<p>And finally, the news of Hunter Seong Jin-Woo returning to South Korea </p>
<p>&lt; Chapter 201 &gt; Fin </p>
