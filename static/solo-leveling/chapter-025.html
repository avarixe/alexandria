<p>I Alone Level-up: Chapter 25</p>
<p>-11 . Arrangement-</p>
<p>It had been 3 days since Jinwoo had returned from the C-rank Gate .  Having come home early on a Saturday, Jinah smelled something delicious and quickly threw off her shoes . </p>
<p>“What’s this? Oppa, did you order chicken?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you got here right on time . ”</p>
<p>“Yay!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo gestured to a seat next to him at the table, and Jinah shuffled towards him with a surprised look . </p>
<p>“But what’s the occasion? Did something good happen to my cheapskate oppa?”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, now . Go put your bags away, you’re being too impatient . ”</p>
<p>“Ha! I’m good, the bag’s not that heavy . ”</p>
<p>This was the same girl who complained about the extra weight of an umbrella in her bag .  Even as he clicked his tongue, Jinwoo struggled to hide the smile on his face . </p>
<p>‘Did something good happen?’</p>
<p>Of course!</p>
<p>The numbers in his bankbook had increased from just 800 thousand to a whopping 180 million and 300 thousand .  The 180 million was the income from selling the magic cores, and 500 thousand won was sent to the landlord as rent . </p>
<p>A hundred and eighty million won!</p>
<p>This was the incredible amount he had obtained from a single Raid .  He had diligently worked as a Hunter in the past, but this was the first time he truly felt like one .  After all, great wealth was associated with being a Hunter, but his past income was not that great . The face of the magic core exchange staff still remained fresh in his mind . </p>
<p>“You, you gathered all of this on your own?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I managed it somehow . ”</p>
<p>“How in the… amazing . ”</p>
<p>49 C-rank magic cores .  Initial estimates were little over 300 million, but the taxes on the sale took a bulk amount . </p>
<p>“40%?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir . A personal sale has a tax rate of 40% . On the other hand, a Guild sale has a tax rate of 10% . ”</p>
<p>“Is there a reason why Guilds get a much better rate?”</p>
<p>“Well unlike a private party, a Guild cannot ignore a mobilization order . ”</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, he recalled that even the great Baekho Guild was pulled into assistance by the Association during the Double Dungeon incident .  Because of the many benefits and leniencies they were allowed, Guilds would comply with the orders from the government and the Association . This made Jinwoo stop and think for a second . </p>
<p>‘Should I just enter a Guild and wait on selling these magic cores?’</p>
<p>But he quickly waved away the thought .  If he became active in a Guild, the Gates he would be entering would be B-rank or A-rank .  The income from those Gates would be much larger than the amount obtained from the C-rank Gate .  There was no need to miserly count every penny on these C-rank magic cores . </p>
<p>‘I can’t just thoughtlessly enter a random Guild to save on taxes for just this amount’</p>
<p>“I understand . I’ll make the transaction . ”</p>
<p>And like that, 180 million won came into his account .  As his sister had guessed, the chicken and beer were to celebrate the large windfall . </p>
<p>“Thank you for the food~”</p>
<p>Jinwoo flicked the forehead of Jinah who was coyly reaching for a can of beer . </p>
<p>thwack!</p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>“This is for you . ”</p>
<p>He placed a can of cola in front of her . </p>
<p>“Hiiing… I was just kidding…”</p>
<p>As Jinah rubbed the red spot on her forehead, Jinwoo took a swig of cold refreshing beer .  An unexpected sound appeared in his head . </p>
<p>ring~</p>
<p>Jinwoo grimaced at the electronic tone . </p>
<p>‘A System message?’</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>A harmful substance has been detected . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The effects of the ‘Detoxification’[1] buff will be activated . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>3, 2, 1… Detoxification complete . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘A harmful substance was detected? Is it talking about the alcohol?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo finished the beer and opened another can . </p>
<p>gulp gulp gulp</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>A harmful substance has been detected . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The effects of the ‘Detoxification’ buff will be activated . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>3, 2, 1… Detoxification complete . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As expected, the same message appeared .  Even after chugging two cans of beer back-to-back, Jinwoo did not feel a hint of a buzz .  The effect of the buff was clear . </p>
<p>‘But when and where did I get a buff?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head .  He had never met a Hunter would could place buffs on others .  Hunters with such special abilities mostly worked for large Guilds .  There was no chance of meeting someone like that under the Association . </p>
<p>‘Even if someone buffed me without knowing, I should’ve gotten a System notification . ’</p>
<p>That left two possibilities .  Either he was buffed while unconscious or he had received the buff before the appearance of the System .  Jinwoo’s thoughts leaned towards the latter . </p>
<p>“Oppa, what’s wrong? Indigestion? Should’ve ate slower . ”</p>
<p>Watching his face deep in thought, Jinah asked with concern . </p>
<p>“No, something just came to mind . You keep eating . ”</p>
<p>He went to his room .  He ran through his memories, trying to remember if he had missed anything in the past . </p>
<p>‘Ah . ’</p>
<p>A realization flashed across his mind . </p>
<p>‘All the quests have had a reward so far, even the penalty quest . But there was one quest that I haven’t verified the reward for . ’</p>
<p>He quickly opened his message box .  At the time, he did not know anything about the System or its rewards, so he had put the message aside, but that message definitely had mentioned a reward as well . </p>
<p>His heartbeat quickened . </p>
<p>Jinwoo scrolled to the last message on the list . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Welcome to becoming a [Player] . (Read)</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>He spoke with a shaky voice,</p>
<p>“Open . ”</p>
<p>ring~</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>This System will help with the growth of the “Player” . </strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Non-compliance with this System’s instructions may result in a penalty . </strong>.   </p>

</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As he thought .  It had mentioned a reward .  He thought back on the first time he heard the voice in his head, back in the underground temple . </p>
<p>[You have fulfilled all conditions of the ‘Secret Quest: The Weak One’s Courage’ . ]</p>
<p>A secret quest was a quest like any other, but Jinwoo had never checked its reward .  All that was on his mind at the time was his impending death . Jinwoo scrolled down on the message,</p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong> . Non-compliance with this System’s instructions may result in a penalty . </strong>.   </p>
<p>Your reward has been received . </p>

<p>Awed by your great courage, the Great Sorcerer Kandiaru has blessed you with a special gift .  Blessed by the Great Kandiaru, you will live a long and healthy life</p>
<p>“A bright future awaits the challenger . ”</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>[3]</strong>. </p>
<p>Everything fell into place . </p>
<p>‘So that’s why my leg was healed…’</p>
<p>The severed leg that was reattached was due to this quest’s reward .  Same with the fact that he could not get drunk off the beer just now . </p>
<p>‘Wait, immunity to all poisons?’</p>
<p>Jinwoo suddenly became alert .  Perhaps even that would be…?</p>
<p>Jinwoo took out an item from his inventory . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Casaka’s Venom Gland</strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Rarity: A</strong>.   </p>

<p>  ‘Casaka’s Armored Scales’: Physical Damage Reduction +20%</p>
<p><strong>  ‘Weakened Muscles’: Strength -35</strong>.   </p>
<p>A pouch containing the refined venom of Casaka .  Drinking will give you a permanently toughened skin, but the venom will also permanently damage your muscles . </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>‘If the muscle debuff was due to the venom, maybe the detoxification buff will block it . ’</p>
<p>Only one way to find out .  Jinwoo closed his eyes and drank the substance from the pouch . </p>
<p>gulp gulp</p>
<p>The thick liquid went down his throat .  He ignored the bitter taste and finished the whole pouch . </p>
<p>‘Bleh, and they say medicine is bitter…’</p>
<p>As the pouch became empty, a message appeared . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>A harmful substance has been detected . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The effects of the ‘Detoxification’ buff will be activated . </strong>. </p>

</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p><strong>The debuff, ‘Weakened Muscles’, has been removed . </strong>. </p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>“It worked!”</p>
<p>Jinwoo raised his fist in the air in triumph and checked his status screen . </p>
<p>‘Stat . ’</p>
<p>.  . </p>
<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Stats</strong>. </p>
<p>Strength: 53</p>
<p>Constitution: 30</p>
<p>Agility: 53</p>
<p>Intelligence: 30</p>
<p><strong>Sense: 36</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>(Available stat points: 0)</strong>.   </p>
<p>Physical Damage Reduction: 20%</p>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
<p>As expected, there was no reduction in strength .  It remained at 53 points, but a new attribute of physical damage reduction had appeared .  An amazing power to reduce all physical damage taken by 20% . </p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>As he celebrated his new stat, Jinah called to him from the living room . </p>
<p>“Oppa, do you know someone named Yoo Jinwoo? An Yoo Jinwoo is looking for you . ”</p>
<p>“I don’t think his name is Yoo Jinwoo…”</p>
<p>He went over to the living room and took the receiver from his sister . </p>
<p>“Hello . ”</p>
<p>-“Hyungnim, it’s me, Yoo Jinho . ”</p>
<p>Of course . </p>
<p>“…How did you get this number?”</p>
<p>-“I know someone in the Association . You weren’t answering your cell phone, so I decided to reach you through your home phone . ”</p>
<p>“Make it short . ”</p>
<p>-“Ah! I apologize, hyungnim . But there’s something I really want to discuss with you . It’s hard to explain over the phone, can we meet up somewhere?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head . </p>
<p>‘After all that, you still want to meet with me?’</p>
<p>-“It’s really important, hyungnim . ”</p>
<p>He was a really strange fellow . </p>
<p>Jinwoo allowed Yoo Jinho exactly 1 hour of his time .  They met at a French café near Jinwoo’s house . Even on a weekday afternoon, the café was packed with people . </p>
<p>“Hyungnim, over here!”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho greeted him happily .  Jinwoo had expanded his senses when he entered but did not notice any other Hunters .  At the very least, this was not going to be an ambush for some retaliation . Well, Jinwoo didn’t exactly recall anything to be retaliated for . </p>
<p>He sat down opposite from Yoo Jinho .  In front of him was half-eaten ice cream in a bowl . </p>
<p>“I didn’t think I’d see you again . ”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho stood up and asked,</p>
<p>“Did you order anything? Shall I go grab some coffee?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay . ”</p>
<p>With a disappointed face, Yoo Jinho sat back down . </p>
<p>Jinwoo opened his mouth to speak,</p>
<p>“So what’s this all about-“</p>
<p>But he was interrupted by a group of students a table over . </p>
<p>“I’m telling you it’s true! You should’ve seen it, it was crazy!”</p>
<p>There were three strong looking boys wearing athletic-club uniforms talking with three girls .  Jinwoo tried to focus on the conversation on hand,</p>
<p>“So what’s this all-“</p>
<p>“What are you talking about! Look at this fucker make up shit in front of girls again!”</p>
<p>“…About…”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you! Holy shit, you want me to show you the pictures? I got the proof right here!”</p>
<p>The male students’ voices were loud, but just as annoying was the giggling female students . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Unable to talk through the loud conversation next to them, Jinwoo got up and quietly walked over to the other table .  The three boys’ faces turned to Jinwoo in unison . </p>
<p>“Could you please quiet down a little? There are other people here . ”</p>
<p>One of the boys mockingly bowed his head . </p>
<p>“Yes sir, yes sir . We’ll be quiet . Sowwy~”</p>
<p>The girls laughed at his apology . </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo just stared at them, then turned around .  Suddenly, something soft hit the back of his head .  A rolled-up napkin fell on to the floor . </p>
<p>“Hahahahaha!”</p>
<p>“Hehehehehehe!”</p>
<p>“Stop it! Haha, stop it!”</p>
<p>The male students laughed out loud, while the female students pretended to stop them and laugh .  Yoo Jinho’s face that was watching the scene started to freeze . </p>
<p>“H-hyungnim…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo grabbed a spoon from Yoo Jinho’s ice cream bowl and went over to the counter . </p>
<p>“Look at that him, he’s going to tell on us . ”</p>
<p>“Waah- mommy, there’s some people being loud, waah . Hahaha”</p>
<p>Even as he walked, the students continued their mocking .  Jinwoo asked the nervous looking shop employee,</p>
<p>“This spoon . How much is it?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry customer, we don’t really sell those spoons . ”</p>
<p>“It’s less than ten thousand, right?”</p>
<p>“Sir? Ah, well… probably…”</p>
<p>Jinwoo placed a ten thousand won bill on the counter and turned around . </p>
<p>“Customer? S-sir?”</p>
<p>Jinwoo ignored the woman’s voice and walked towards the students’ table .  Seeing him approach with a serious expression, the male students rose up from their seats . </p>
<p>“What, you wanna go?”</p>
<p>Every eye in the shop was focused on the scene that was unfolding . </p>
<p>Jinwoo held out the spoon that he was holding to the boys . </p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>As they looked at him with confusion, Jinwoo slowly closed his fist around the spoon .  The metallic spoon crumpled into an unrecognizable mess in his hand . </p>
<p>The boys’ faces began to turn white . </p>
<p>toss</p>
<p>roll roll roll</p>
<p>The thing that rolled across the table could no longer be called a spoon .  It was a piece of metal crushed into a ball shape . </p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>Each of the boys gulped . </p>
<p>‘That’s not an ordinary human’s strength . ’</p>
<p>‘H-he’s a Hunter . ’</p>
<p>As they cast glances at each other, the boy who had thrown the paper napkin was the first to lower his head . </p>
<p>“I’m… I’m sorry . ”</p>
<p>The other two quickly followed . </p>
<p>“Sorry…”</p>
<p>“We made a mistake . Sorry…”</p>
<p>After repeatedly bowing their heads, the boys quickly ran out of the café with the girls in tow . </p>
<p>Whoa-</p>
<p>The other customers, also bothered by the students’ loud rambling, sent a silent gratitude toward Jinwoo .  He returned to his seat . Yoo Jinho exclaimed with sparkles in his eyes,</p>
<p>“As expected of hyungnim!”</p>
<p>“Enough . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo steered the conversation back to the start,</p>
<p>“So . What . Is . This . About?”</p>
<p>“Well… hyungnim . I gave it a lot of thought . Like, I really really thought about it hard . And there’s something I want to ask you . ”</p>
<p>Jinwoo tilted his head,</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Hyungnim, the truth is…”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinho’s face turned red with embarrassment .  He gathered the courage to finish his sentence . </p>
<p>“…I’m trying to create a private raiding party-“</p>
<p>It didn’t even take Jinwoo one second to think about it . </p>
<p>“I refuse . ”</p>
<p>  . </p>
